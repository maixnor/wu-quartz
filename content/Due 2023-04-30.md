- bankruptcy is like survival of the fittest, but for companies
- "selling" receivables as assets is quite smart with mortgage pass through
	- what happens to mortgages when the bank with pass through goes bankrupt?
- information ... why not make everything public and only sell your "insights" of that data as credit ratings. Each company can do their own calculations/predictions -> no more [[Herding]]
- regulation, more like standardization and less like actual market intervention
	- not that I think it is wrong, it is named poorly
- ISDA, 2006 ... is this actually necessary for the market to function or just another benefit for the top 1%?

- nice talking speed, 2.5x is easily possible
- "You can trust someone not trustworthy, then you mad a mistake" I like that quote
- the 4 big C's (character, capacity, capital, collateral)
- "Big Data of the 1880s"
- social implications of low credit score, like dystopian social score
