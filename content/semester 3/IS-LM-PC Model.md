# Natural Rates
- unemployment and production
$$
Y_{n}= N_{n} = (1-u_n)L
$$
- output gap: $Y - Y_{n}$
	- should be as close to 0 as possible -> healthy economy
- following that: $Y-Y_{n} = -L(u-u_{n})$
	- when output gap positive: overheated economy
		- inflationary pressure 
		- overheated economy ... more demand than supply
	- when output gap negative: recession
