- finite repeated game

	- [[Backward Induction]]
	- NE of last round is 0.8/0.8, therefore all the rounds before too
- classic [[Prisoners Dilemma]]
- why did this work better than [[Experiment 2 and 3 GT1#Setting 2 - simultaneous|Experiment 2]]?
	- only 2 partners - easier to collude and communicate
