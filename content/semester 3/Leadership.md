## Framework
- leader
- leadership behavior
- led employees
- leadership success

## Measurement
- how to measure if you are a good leader?
- given a team of sufficient skills, how fast can you reach a goal
- and

# Styles
##  task oriented

- is the group coordinated?
- does the group have all the information they need?

##  relationship oriented
- wait for decision of group
- make sure people work well together
- promote communication over content

## others
- transactional
	- set clear short-term goals with clear benefits/rewards 
	- make things run smoothly
- transformational
	- focus on common, long-term goals
	- think outside the box
	- 
- not mutually exclusive
- not dependent on personal traits

## effectiveness
- depending if the style is fitting the situation
	- control, context, etc
	- low (assembly line) and high (creative work) control over work situations task-oriented style is best
	- medium control over work situation is relationship-oriented style best

# Components
## Stereotypes
- talkativeness
	- information is not important, just frequency
- dominance & assertiveness
	- nonverbal signs included
- embodiment of group stereotypes

# Theories
## Good Person Theory
 - leaders are born, not made

	 - not quite wrong, but the correlation is only 0.3, so rather weak
	 - IQ is also only 0.27 correlated

# Culture vs Leadership
## Introduce a new and diverse Leader
- start with communication, not with content
- hype the new hire, regardless of age, origin, etc
	- negative traits will be attributed anyways, add just positives
- express support from everyone else for the new hire
- explain the reasons why the new hire was picked
	- worst: we picked her just because she is a woman
		- problem is not the statement, but the selection process
- first introduce the new leader to present hierarchies and modes of operation
	- worst is new leader has to ask for how things work
