- papers are only peer-reviewed, not reproduced
- many papers cannot be reproduced
- only 36% of papers were reproducible (with psychology)
	- 2/3 of all papers are just wrong
- astrophysicists are statistically proven wrong the most times -> therefore best papers
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis

# Why did it happen?
- publishing is a wrongly incentivised field
- incentive for answer to be...
	- always correct
	- universally applicable
	- easy to believe

# Remedies
- the pressure is not as high to create positives, nulls are ok and are published
- data must be public, so at least the statistics are reproducible
- pre-registration: defining the [[experiment]] before actually doing it and analyzing 
- meta-analysis: taking a bunch of papers (40-100) and finding out about differences
  - look for a meta analysis when diving into new subjects!!!

# Methods of Deception

## p-hacking
- [[Data Dredging]]

## Effect Size
- huge effect: women vs men weight difference
  - minimum 80 samples needed to be significant 
  - should be 100 or 200 for most studies
- small effect: milliseconds spent when looking at numbers
  - much larger sample sizes needed
- using a too small sample size proves insignificant and is unlikely to be reproducible

## Harking
- [[HARKing]]

## Funnel Plot:
- plot result vs population size
- easy to spot publication bias
  - if some parts/results are left out one will find it here
  - mostly "too boring" to be published
