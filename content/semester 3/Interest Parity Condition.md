- if investing in foreign economy with a foreign currency:
- cannot invest euro into US governments bonds
	- need to exchange EUR to USD before purchase
	- need to exchange USD to EUR after bond has reached maturity
- within [[Mundell-Fleming Model]] there is no exchange rate, so this does not happen

# EU
- within EU most countries use Euros - no exchange rate means that investors are indifferent where to invest their assets
