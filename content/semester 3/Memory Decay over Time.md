# Implicit vs Explicit
- implicit memory decays slower, explicit faster

## Empirical
- Mitchell (2006)
	- n = 33
	- 17 years ago shown pictures for 1-3 seconds
	- test now: 12.5% better memory for implicit, no improvement in explicit memory of those pictures
	- subjects could not remember anything from 17 years ago explicitly when asked, but still remembered having seen those images before

- Mitchell, Kelly & Brown (2017) (replication)
	- n = 28
	- 11-14 years, pictures and words
	- 12.3% better for pictures, 20.9% better for words, no improvement with explicit memory

# Ebbinghaus
- Ebbinghaus 1885/1913
	- n = 1
	- memorize nonsense syllables to find out about forgetting
	- found out about the [[#^b6217c|ebbinghaus forgetting curve]]
	- re-learning is faster and easier than learning it for the first time

- ebbinghaus forgetting curve ^b6217c
	- if you missed a few slides the best place is right before the exam
	- there is a baseline where nothing is lost
	- after 2 days the most is gone
		- positive: what is still there after 2 days will stay for longer
	- 20 minutes: working memory
	- 2 days: free-floating long-term memory
	- it's okay to not know everything
		- do you want to know everything for a short period
		- or
		- do you want to remember what you know now for longer times
		- pick 1 of them
