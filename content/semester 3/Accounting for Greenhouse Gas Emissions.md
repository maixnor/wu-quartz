# Why is it important?
- climate scientist underestimate recent warming effects
- extreme weather anomalies reaching higher than ever before
- Austria
	- average temperature deviation rising 
		- +2.6 degrees on average, more in cities than in mountains

# ESRS
- [[ESRS]] [[E1]]

# GHG Protocol Standards

# Corporate vs Product Carbon Footprint
- #todo
- product carbon footprint
	- technically hard to calculate
- 2 different perspectives on the same emissions
	- e.g. apple, emissions of the whole company vs emissions per iPhone produced
	- not double-counting, since it is the same emissions

# Generally Accepted GHG Accounting Principles
#todo 
- relevance
- completeness
- consistency
- transparency
- accuracy
	- everything is an estimation
	- but the goal is to remove uncertainties and not over/underrepresent emissions
