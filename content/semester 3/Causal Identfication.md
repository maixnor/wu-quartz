# Explanatory Modeling
- theory -> hypotheses -> statistical test -> effect size & result
- [[Counterfactual]]

## Conditions
- X: independent 
- Y: dependent
- Y follows X temporally
- Y changes as X changes and the relationship is significant
- No other cause should eliminate the relation between X and Y
	- changes in X produce changes in Y
	- ceteris paribus (holding all else constant)
