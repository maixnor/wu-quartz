## Voting
- [[arrows impossibility theorem]]
	- no voting system can ever be perfect

- plurality voting
	- first pick
	- winner: highest vote count
- borda voting
	- full ranking of preferences
		- first pick: score n-1, last pick: score 0
	- winner: preference with highest score 
- approval voting
	- subset of "acceptable choices"
	- winner: preference acceptable to most
- veto voting
	- negative of approval voting
		- anti-vote
	- winner: preference not acceptable to least 

#todo strategic non-truthful voting
- put your nemesis at the beginning, then your actual preference at the last point
	- agendas matter
