	- similar activation/context
	- e.g. person has a new boyfriend/girlfriend. Always mixing up previous/current name
- proactive interference (forward)
	- previous is clashing with new knowledge
- retroactive interference (backward)
	- old knowledge overwritten by new knowledge
	- forgetting triggered by learning or processing new information
- interference works only on simple memories
	- complex memories are immune to interference
	- enough connections = no simple interference
