# People
- Alexander Gall - KPMG Partner
	- early adopter of [[ESG]] reporting
- Claudia Schoenhart - KPMG Manager
	- also [[EU Taxonomy Regulation]]

# Regulatory Framework
- "some level of assurance" could also be just 1 KPI
	- like C-level renumeration tied to CO2 emissions
- sus. reports grew from ~30 to ~100 pages
- handling of financial data is very mature (50+ years) and simple
	- providing assurance is comparably simple as well
- ESG data handling is not mature yet
	- has not been around long enough to be mature
	- no double-accounting paradigm for ESG data
	- archiving is a difficult topic too
- some companies do other stuff too apart from [[ESRS]] and [[CSRD]]
	- see [[ESG]]
- [[CSRD]] is a directive -> no obligation until transposed into national law
	- citizens and companies not affected until transposition is done
- new [[CSRD]] give a lot more structure over [[ISAE 3000]]

## Politics
- focus is currently on bigger issues: taxes and budgets
- sustainability reporting is low on the priority list
	- possibility that nobody will talk about it and it will just be passed
		- minimum requirements - resources needed in other places
	- possibility that AT government waits for DE governments decision
		- DE will most likely have a different government too
		- possibility that new government(s) requests changes from EU
