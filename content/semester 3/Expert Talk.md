# People
- Alexander Gall - KPMG Partner
	- early adopter of [[ESG]] reporting
- Claudia Schoenhart - KPMG Manager
	- also [[EU Taxonomy Regulation]]

# Regulatory Framework
- "some level of assurance" could also be just 1 KPI
	- like C-level renumeration tied to CO2 emissions
- sus. reports grew from ~30 to ~100 pages
- handling of financial data is very mature (50+ years) and simple
	- providing assurance is comparably simple as well
- ESG data handling is not mature yet
	- has not been around long enough to be mature
	- no double-accounting paradigm for ESG data
	- archiving is a difficult topic too
- some companies do other stuff too apart from [[ESRS]] and [[CSRD]]
	- see [[ESG]]
- [[CSRD]] is a directive -> no obligation until transposed into national law
	- citizens and companies not affected until transposition is done
- new [[CSRD]] give a lot more structure over [[ISAE 3000]]
- IT tools for ESG are numerous
	- a lot will die out - there is a tool for everything
	- not yet 1 dominant tool or 1 industry standard
	- interesting stuff
		- just a file explorer/archiving solution or is much more data processing happening?
		- e.g. a carbon footprint processing tool
			- what are the inputs and the calculations/processes
- reasonable assurance readiness assessment
	- do you have processes and systems in place to support reasonable assurance someday?
	- no guarantee that reasonable assurance will work out when the deadline hits
- [[Assurance]]
- Sustainability Reporting has the power to close companies
	- lying about sustainabiltiy to get further credit
	- having to repay financing after fraud becomes public
	- insolvency
- when reasonable assurance fails a lot of government regulation will follow
	- if there should be a serious case of [[Greenwashing]] in ESG reporting the regulations would be revisited
- site visits
	- where is data coming from - really understanding how the process works and what data is coming from where
- sustainability auditing requires a lot more travelling than financial audits
- 

## Politics
- important for companies: should they prepare reports (a lot of costs are involved)
	- if it is not mandatory I might as well wait for a year
- focus is currently on bigger issues: taxes and budgets
	- no wins/losses with doing something you would have to anyways
- sustainability reporting is low on the priority list
	- possibility that nobody will talk about it and it will just be passed
		- minimum requirements - resources needed in other places
	- possibility that AT government waits for DE governments decision
		- DE will most likely have a different government too
		- possibility that new government(s) requests changes from EU
