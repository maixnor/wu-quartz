# People
- Alexander Gall - KPMG Partner
	- early adopter of [[ESG]] reporting
- Claudia Schoenhart - KPMG Manager
	- also [[EU Taxonomy Regulation]]

# Regulatory Framework
- "some level of assurance" could also be just 1 KPI
	- like C-level renumeration tied to CO2 emissions
- sus. reports grew from ~30 to ~100 pages
- handling of financial data is very mature (50+ years) and simple
	- providing assurance is comparably simple as well
- ESG data handling is not mature yet
	- has not been around long enough to be mature
	- no double-accounting paradigm for ESG data
	- archiving is a difficult topic too
- some companies do other stuff too apart from [[ESRS]] and [[CSRD]]
	- see [[ESG]]
- [[CSRD]] is a directive -> no obligation until transposed into national law
	- citizens and companies not affected until transposition is done
- new [[CSRD]] give a lot more structure over [[ISAE 3000]]
- IT tools for ESG are numerous
	- a lot will die out - there is a tool for everything
	- not yet 1 dominant tool or 1 industry standard
	- interesting stuff
		- just a file explorer/archiving solution or is much more data processing happening?
		- e.g. a carbon footprint processing tool
			- what are the inputs and the calculations/processes
- reasonable assurance readiness assessment
	- do you have processes and systems in place to support reasonable assurance someday?
	- no guarantee that reasonable assurance will work out when the deadline hits
- [[Assurance]]
- Sustainability Reporting has the power to close companies
	- lying about sustainabiltiy to get further credit
	- having to repay financing after fraud becomes public
	- insolvency
- when reasonable assurance fails a lot of government regulation will follow
	- if there should be a serious case of [[Greenwashing]] in ESG reporting the regulations would be revisited
- site visits
	- where is data coming from - really understanding how the process works and what data is coming from where
	- depends on regional differences and on the people
		- can be friendly and open with some topics, but not with others
		- some just want to get it over with and don't want to work with you at all
	- e.g. measure waste water values to proof the values of the client are correct
- sustainability auditing requires a lot more travelling than financial audits

## Politics
- important for companies: should they prepare reports (a lot of costs are involved)
	- if it is not mandatory I might as well wait for a year
- focus is currently on bigger issues: taxes and budgets
	- no wins/losses with doing something you would have to anyways
- sustainability reporting is low on the priority list
	- possibility that nobody will talk about it and it will just be passed
		- minimum requirements - resources needed in other places
	- possibility that AT government waits for DE governments decision
		- DE will most likely have a different government too
		- possibility that new government(s) requests changes from EU

# Auditors approach & conclusion
- forming conclusion is very structured and formal
	- processed by lawyers and experts how to formulate every single detail
- [[Risk Management]]
	- media research
		- googling "company + issue"
		- e.g. "Microsoft greenwashing"
		- if not included in report -> questions

## Double Materiality Approach
- general questions - understand scope
- how whey have done [[Due Diligence]]
	- [[Value Chain]], [[Shareholder Engagement]]
- identify [[IRO]]s and [[KPI]]s
- find out how [[IRO]]s are captured and transferred into [[KPI]]s
- asses [[KPI]] outcome

# Key challenges - practical examples
- under [[ESRS]] no quantitative data may have omissions
	- check for completeness required

# Q&A / Discussion
- who are you talking to exactly in the companies?
	- C-suite (whoever is responsible for sustainability)
	- different managers - whoever has important information
		- e.g. won't ask finance dept about biodiversity
		- mostly those people are spread across a lot of departments - there is normally not 1 sustainability department
	- HR does social matters mostly
- The better you can read a persons mind the better of an auditor you are
- for the change to reasonable assurance to happen one needs to proof that being sustainable has benefits - otherwise the companies will protest heavily because of extra incurred costs for no benefit
- different ways to enforce reasonable assurance other than just requirements for everything
	- e.g. if CEO renumeration is linked to sustainability KPIs
	- e.g. if green bonds are listed on the stock market
