- Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive
	- directive = needs to be transposed
	- another deadline Austria has to meet
- aim at some point
	- EU companies with 1k+ employees and >450 mil EUR turnover globally
	- very huge companies, even larger than [[PIEs]]
	- why only so large companies?
		- mostly about politics, drafts were more strict
		- hard to apply regulation which forces behavior instead of just disclosing

# Requirements
- Due Diligence process
	- risk assessment
		- [[Double Materiality]] applies here
	- risk management systems
	- notification systems
		- similar to [[whistleblower]] hotline
	- prevention and corrective action plans
	- climate transition plan
		- also included in [[ESRS]] [[E1]]
- Chain of Activities
	- own operations
	- operations of subsidiaries
	- operations of direct and indirect business partners
- Documentation & Disclosure
	- not just disclosure, first implement due diligence process and then disclose on what you have **DONE**, not just what data you have collected

# Due Diligence Process
- Code of Conduct
	- Employees + Suppliers
- Risk Assessment
	- identify adverse impacts
	- rank based on severity and likelihood
	- similar to [[Materiality Assesment]], but with risks
- Prevention and Mitigation
	- prevent/mitigate adverse impact
- Notification Mechanism
	- trade unions, people effected, civil society organisations can bring in complaints
	- complaints have to be viewed
- Monitoring and Communicating
	- annual statement
	- reassessment every year
- Provide Remediation
	- adverse impact that can't be prevented/mitigated anymore have to be compensated
	- e.g. farmer dying on a field

# Non-Compliance
- Penalties
	- based on global net sales
	- may not be less than 5% in relation to previous year
- Civil Liabilities
	- intentional or negligent breach of duty
	- requires proof of causation (could have been prevented/mitigated)
	- no civil liability if harm solely caused by business partners within the supply chain

# Climate Transition Plan
- goal: compatibility with the Paris 1.5 target and climate neutrality
- actual steps which need to be defined
	- climate targets for 2030 and 5 year steps until 2050 regarding [[GHG Emissions]]
	- decarbonization levers identified
	- quantification of investments/financial resources necessary
	- role of administrative, management and supervisory bodies
	- update the plan every 12 months
		- easy to fake the new report every 12 months
- obligation of implementation and action
	- what is in the report needs to happen, if a climate target is not reached bc the estimates were wrong there are no sanctions
	- again linked to [[Transparency Theory]] for enforcing change through stakeholders
- **not** obligation of success
	- no obligation to report failure, can just move deadline 2 years back
	- kind of [[Greenwashing]], since only relative [[GHG Emissions]] are part of the report, not actual numbers
