# Difference to Game Theory
- psychology plays a role
- traditional game theory appears as if they are selfish and rational
- everything can be expressed as a monetary number
	- how much do I have to pay you to "buy your outcome"?
- Utility is only the monetary amount
	- think extra about changes in [[Marginal Changes]]
		- e.g. [[Diminishing Marginal Returns]]
- 

# Utility
 - the same value is not worth equal amounts to different people
 - personal preferences
	 - e.g. Rivalry - I don't care how much I earn, as long as it is more than you earn
	 - e.g. War - I don't care how much I lose, as long as it is less than you lose
