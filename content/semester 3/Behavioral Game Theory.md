# Difference to Game Theory
- psychology plays a role
- traditional game theory appears as if they are selfish and rational
- everything can be expressed as a monetary number
	- how much do I have to pay you to "buy your outcome"?
- Utility is only the monetary amount
	- think extra about changes in [[Marginal Changes]]
		- e.g. [[Diminishing Marginal Returns]]

## Greed
> Greed is good. Greed is right. Greed works. Greed cuts through, clarifies, and captures the essence of the evolutionary spirit

&amp; Gekko

But:
- Greed leads to monopolies to use their power

## Ultimatum vs Dictator
- [[dictator game]] was invented to show how much of the [[ultimatum game]] was due to nice offers and how much due to the offerer being afraid of the offer being refused

# A better Explanation
## Utility & Social Preferences
 - the same value is not worth equal amounts to different people
	 - think more about utility, less about value or money when [[Analyzing Games]] 
	 - firms are just maximizing profit mostly, minimal social preferences
 - humans are social creatures - comparison to others are important
	 - i.e. humans are not just rational
 - personal preferences
	 - e.g. Rivalry - I don't care how much I earn, as long as it is more than you earn
	 - e.g. War - I don't care how much I lose, as long as it is less than you lose
### Inequality aversion
- i am interested in my income
- but also about my income relative to the relative income
- results: inequality aversion 
	- I don't want to be much better/worse off than others
	- If I am already worse off I don't want the others to have even more
	- If I am already better off I don't want to have more than other others
- asymmetry: might care more about me being worse off than better off

### Intentions and Reciprocity
- how nice were they to me and how nice I was to them
- #todo gt1 5 62-
- not just result but also intentions matter and the beliefs of both players about each others intentions
- 2 [[Nash Equilibrium|equilibria]] (unkind/unkind) and (kind/kind)
	- what will be played is dependent of player A's action
- no reciprocity, B cannot be kind/unkind back towards A

#### Reciprocity in Labor Market
- people work for their money, even if they are not controlled
- people work harder if they get more money

## Altruism and Spite
#todo gt1 5 58

# Economist Effect
- #todo gt1 5 67
- result: "Economists are born, not made"

## Oxytocin and Brain Scan
- players with higher oxytocin levels are more trusting and more trustworthy
- in recent years it was more feasible to analyse brain waves during the game
