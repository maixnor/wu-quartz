# Difference to Game Theory
- psychology plays a role
- traditional game theory appears as if they are selfish and rational
- everything can be expressed as a monetary number
	- how much do I have to pay you to "buy your outcome"?
- Utility is only the monetary amount
	- think extra about changes in [[Marginal Changes]]
		- e.g. [[Diminishing Marginal Returns]]

## Greed
> Greed is good. Greed is right. Greed works. Greed cuts through, clarifies, and captures the essence of the evolutionary spirit

But:
- Greed leads to monopolies to use their power

## Ultimatum vs Dictator
- dictator game was invented to show how much of the ultimatum game was due to nice offers and how much due to the offerer being afraid of the offer being refused

# A better Explanation
## Utility
 - the same value is not worth equal amounts to different people
 - humans are social creatures - comparison to others are important
	 - i.e. humans are not just rational
 - personal preferences
	 - e.g. Rivalry - I don't care how much I earn, as long as it is more than you earn
	 - e.g. War - I don't care how much I lose, as long as it is less than you lose
### Inequality aversion
- i am interested in my income
- but also about my income relative to the relative income
- results: inequality aversion 
	- I don't want to be much better/worse off than others
	- If I am already worse off I don't want the others to have even more
	- If I am already better off I don't want to have more than other others
- asymmetry: might care more about me being worse off than better off
