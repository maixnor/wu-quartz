- CCF - Corporate Carbon Footprint

# Data Collection
## Measure
- operating cost statements
- fuel and chemical purchases
- mileage reports
- supplier reports

## Estimate
- intensity based
	- per m2, production unit, turnover euro
- company-specific or industry average

# Emission Factors
- most activities have certain factors
	- e.g. fruit (product of fruit overseas)
- different products/activities can have different factors
	- e.g. organic bananas from panama are different from just fruit
	- e.g. short vs long distance flight per km

# How to Calculate
- find activities (from all 3 scopes)
- multiply activity with relevant [[GHG emission factor]]
- sum up for each of the 3 scopes
- sum 3 scopes together

# Scopes
## Scope 1
- stationary combustion
- mobile combustion
- process emissions
- fugitive emissions
	- e.g. refrigeration system leak
- biogenic carbon emissions
	- wood/pellets

## Scope 2 
- purchased electricity (location based)
- purchased electricity (market based)
- steam
- heating/cooling
- biogenic carbon emissions
	- wood/pellets

| Method         | Explanation                                               | Emission factor                                   | Strength                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Weakness                                                                                                                                                                               |

| Location-based | Use of country- or more region-specific emission factors. | Grid average                                      | Enables Comparability  <br> + between locations within a country/region <br> + between companies of the same industry                                                                                                          | - Low influenceability                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Market-based   | Use of source- or supplier-specific emission factors.     | Specific factor of the respective energy supplier | Active control of the supplied energy & consideration in the GHG balance. Example Green electricity: <br> + Scope 2: 0 emissions <br> + Scope 3:  <br>  Consideration of emissions from the generation plants in category 3.3. | - Crediting green electricity with zero emissions removes the incentive to reduce energy consumption <br> - Emissions from the generation facilities are often not taken into account. |
- the point of location vs market based is that the market based should be lower than the location based
	- signals special contracts the company has that leverage renewables

## Scope 3

### Upstream
- purchased goods & services
- capital & capital goods
- fuel and energy-related activities
- upstream transportation (not part of own fleet)
- waste generation in upstream
- business traveling
- employee commuting
- upstream leased assets

### Downstream
- downstream transportation (not part of own fleet)
- processing of products sold
- used of sold products
- end-of-life treatment
- downstream leased assets
- franchises
- investments (interesting for banks)
