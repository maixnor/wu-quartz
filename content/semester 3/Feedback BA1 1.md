- emphasize HEX before doing anything in Binary 
- include actual value of 0.3, then why 0.3 / 3 != 0.1
- floating point numbers simpler
	- explain by fractions of 1 -> 0.5, 0.25, 0.125, ...
- lossy/lossless compression difference
- explain pointers and addresses before talking about memory
	- rerouting of parcel -> change address instead of moving your house
	- nullpointer not as a side-note -> parcel not deliverable, what now?
	- maybe also dangling objects right then and there
- for array/linked list use actual 3 numbers to store into memory
