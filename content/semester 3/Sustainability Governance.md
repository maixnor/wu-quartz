# Governance Structure
## Legislation
### [[NFRD]] or [[NaDiVeG]]
- responsibility for reporting and supervision
	- supervisory board needs to check if the published report looks okay
- after supervisory board approves it is included in annual report

### [[CSRD]]
- new reporting requirement 
	- expertise and skills, roles, incentive schemes of management and supervisory board need to be disclosed
- responsibility for supervision
	- tasks of the audit committee (i.e. subset of [[supervisory board]] to check on the sustainability report)

## Management Level
![[governance_managent_level.png]]
### Types
- financial-centered sustainability department reporting to CFO
- operation-centered sustainability department reporting to COO
- chief sustainability officer CSO operating across departments
	- best results in terms of international studies
		- done by [[The Big 4]]
- different sub-departments or people regarding sustainability in each department 

## Supervisory Level
- checking content of the sustainabiltiy report
- 3-20 members dependent on size of company
	- works typically in committees (renumeration, nomiation, audit, ...)
### Types
- just audit committee (smaller companies)
- audit committee + sustainability expert
- extra sustainability committee (large enterprises)

## Organizational Embeddedness
- general sustainability reporting lies with CEO
	- finance department may do the data analysis and the "sustainability accounting", but actually implementing and improving their sustainability lies with other people

## Empirical Evidence

# Incentive Schemes
- applicable renumeration for management level
	- creates incentive for board members to care about sustainability

# # Sustainability Strategy
## Ambition Levels
![[sust_strategy.png]]
- purpose-driven:
	- going above and beyond
	- (hopefully) positive stakeholder reaction
- opportunities-driven:
	- use [[EU Taxonomy Regulation]] for innovation ideas, not just for mandatory reporting
- risk-driven:
	- risk of public/shareholder pressure
	- risk of effects of [[climate change]] and environmental damage 
- compliance-driven:
	- rather comply than face sanctions
	
## Strategy
### Stakeholder Engagement
- determine material sustainability matters
	- [[Double Materiality]]
	- [[Materiality Assesment]]
- develop, vision, mission, strategy
	- attitude about climate protection
- define goals and targets
	- intermediate targets to reach final goals:
	- [[GHG Emissions]] scope 1 and 2 net-zero by 2040
	- [[GHG Emissions]] net-zero including scope 3
### Employee Engagement
- define [[KPI]]s
	- energy efficiency in operations
	- percentage of renewable energy
	- percentage of EVs in fleet
- define actions
	- examples:
		- joining [[SBTi]]
		- reduction of leakage in operations
		- purchase of renewable energy
		- installment of PVs
		- purchase of EVs
- monitoring
	- establish internal systems to regularly monitor progress and achievements
	- adjust the strategy as needed to respond to changing conditions

## Define Targets
- key characteristics
	- [[SMART]] targets
- public commitment
	- transparency, reputation
- inputs for target setting
	- benchmarking with competitors
	- regulatory targets
	- stakeholder expectations
- process of target setting
	- how to change current performance

## Define Actions
- employee engagement
	- awareness, awards, prizes
	- culture of sustainability -> [[corporate culture]]
- technology and innovation
	- new technologies, artificial intelligence maybe?
- cross-functional collaboration
	- alignment across departments
	- integrated solutions
- evaluation of actions
	- criteria for effective measures
	- confidence level, strategic relevance, time-horizon, reputation ([[greenwashing]]), etc

# Data Management and [[KPI]]s
## The Issue
![[sust_data.png]]

> You can't manage what you aren't measuring

- data aspect is very bad in most companies
	- most use spreadsheets
	- mostly about missing standardization efforts 
- not included in forecasting and budgeting either
	- missing out on [[Strategic Foresight]] and [[Scenario Planning]] improvements
- if data was measured efficiently one could imagine a "race to the top" to optimize for emissions, etc
	- fueled by right [[#Incentive Schemes]] for C-suite and competition

## Data Pyramid
- first ... most important but fewest data points, last ... inverse
- [[KPI]]s
	- Revenue, CAPEX, OPEX -> [[EU Taxonomy Regulation]]
- Datapoints require external assurance
- Datapoints require external reporting
- Potential sustainability-related datapoints
