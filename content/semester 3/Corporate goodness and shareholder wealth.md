## Abstract
Using a unique data set, I study how stock markets react to positive and negative events concerned with a firm's corporate social responsibility (CSR). I show that investors respond strongly negatively to negative events and weakly negatively to positive events. I then show that investors do value “offsetting CSR,” that is positive CSR news concerning firms with a history of poor stakeholder relations. In contrast, investors respond negatively to positive CSR news which is more likely to result from agency problems. Finally, I provide evidence that CSR news with stronger legal and economic information content generates a more pronounced investor reaction.

## 1 Introduction
- economic theory
	- don't internalize negative externalities
	- create profit
- agency problem: good CSR news = bad for shareholders
	- solve by taking a look at low liquidity, high leverage firms
		- not enough money around to spend on negative NPV CSR projects
- value motivation: "doing well by doing good"
- companies have incentive to greenwash
- reverse causality:
	- doing well by doing good
	- OR doing good by doing well
	- solved by short-run event study
- better-off firms have better CSR performance
- short term stock price movement reflects [[Net Present Value]] of event

- negative CSR news
	- environment/communities more pronounced
	- movement DOWN
	- social irresponsibility
	- cost: 76 Million
		- maybe just cost of doing business -> what can be gained should the bad news improve
- positive CSR news
	- environment/communities more pronounced
	- movement DOWN, but way less
	- investors don't like CSR
	- investors hate no CSR even more
	- better reaction to improving something bad than just improving
		- there is a reason to improve bad CSR

## 2 Literature
- excess returns 
	- good CSR companies
	- good CSR portfolios
- no risk/return difference to conventional portfolios
- democratically leaning executives care more about shareholders than republican
- agency problems

## 3 Data
- public information between 2001 and 2007
	- e.g. news of poor labor relations
	- e.g. report on toxic waste water dumping
- areas
	- community
	- corporate governancne
	- diversity
	- employee relations
	- environment
	- human rights
	- product
- KLD Socrates -> MSCI ESG Ratings
- CSR policies are mostly costly
- CSR is often seen as charitable giving -> cash flow shock
- slightly positive reaction to positive product news -> market leader, etc
	- surprising that positive reaction is not more pronounced

## 5 Agency Motivated
- positive news better received from high leverage companies
	- probably less agency mismatch than high liquidity companies

## 6 Textual Analysis
- counting words per category (positive, negative, legal, economics, digits, etc)
- more hard facts in negative news
	- more digits, legal terms 

## 7 Conclusion
- stronger reaction to more extreme news
- more positive reaction if agency problems are less probable
	- higher leverage, lower liquidity
- more positive reaction if past irresponsibility is addressed
	- especially in community and environmental factors
- negative reaction if just responsible
- more positive reaction if news are legal/economic
