# Globalization, Specialization, Free Markets
- integrated commodity markets
	- greater world trade, broader range of goods
- [[Division of Labor]]
- industrial vs peripheral economies
	- "[[Great Specialization]]"

## Globalization - What?
- [[Globalization#History]]
	- fast growth between 1840 and 1900 - idea of progress
	- 1918 - 1950 doubt about progress idea
- globalization
	- globalization measured in [[Market Integration]]
	- [[Movement of X]] goods, labor, capital, land more/easier
		- movement of land ... conquest of settlement, [[Imperialism]], migration
	- political, social, cultural, regulatory, etc implications
	
## Specialization - What?
- [[Great Specialization]]

## Glob and Spec - Why?
- [[industrial revolution]] spread from UK -> [[Script 3 Summary#Industrial Revolution ... Again]]
- industrialization slow in the rest of the world
	- value of 16 ... industrialization level of UK in 1800
![[industrialization_outside_uk.png]]
### Role of Trade
- raw materials and food for core countries
	- e.g. raw cotton to UK
- consume produced products
	- e.g. cotton cloth from UK
- -> [[Market Integration]]
- can overproduce locally and sell to other countries
	- actively search for new markets
- slightly higher export prices over time

### Trade and Transaction Costs
- [[Distance Cost]]

### Trade Policy Liberalization
- lowered import/export tariffs (first in UK, then the rest)
- AVE ... tariffs
![[tariffs_vs_import.png]]
#### example: japan opening after 1853
- Harris treaty of 1858
- [[Comparative Advantage]] emerged naturally
	- Silk, silkworm eggs, tea exported
	- cotton yarn, sugar, rice imported
- industrialization happening after opening

### Gold Standard
- [[Gold Standard]]

### Peace in Europe
- before 1815 europe in war all the time
	- embargoes -> cant trade with enemy
	- privateering -> private pirates instead of actual navies
	- wartime -> merchant ships converted into warships
	- uncertainty

### Imperialism
- [[Imperialism]]

### International Migration
- suitable cultivation areas used productively
- larger share of transnational vs national migration and greater total migration
- mostly from Britain (40%) to US (60%)

### International Investment
![[international_investment.png]]
- >90% of those investments from industrializing European areas which need raw materials
	- exporting population for imports of raw materials
	- North America, Europe, Latin America (Argentina Brazil), Ozeania
- 43% from Britain, 20% Franc, 13% Germany
- invenstments went where the migration went
	- mostly Europe, US, Latin America; a bit of Asia too
	- institutions similar to investment source
- Why invest abroad?
	- higher returns on capital for increased uncertainty/risk
- migrating population younger than average, no/little savings
	- if savings, spent on travel and setup
- high fertility rate, low savings in migrated locations -> [[Script 2 Summary]]
- high need for infrastructure -> high interest rates
	- abundant land, secure institutions and good productivity -> benefits of investments high too

## Glob and Spec - Consequences
### Prices converging
![[prices_converging.png]]

### Consequences
- spread of industrialization
	- source of growth
- core countries had 80% of the market
- core countries determined development of the rest of the world
- periphery countries were dependent on core countries and their relation to them
