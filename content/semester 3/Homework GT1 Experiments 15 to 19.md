# Experiment 18
## Nash Equilibria Normal Form
![[exp_18_normal_form.png]]
- 2 opposite NE 
	- 1 stay, 2 steer
	- 1 steer, 2 stay
- I can only gain what you loose (opportunity cost)

## Difference to Prisoners Dilemma
- PD has just 1 clear NE in normal form and 1 better NE if collusion is possible
	- as long as I don't deviate, there is no chance of being hurt by other player
- this game has 2 NE where the activity of either player is always hurting the other player through opportunity cost 
	- risk of a crash which hurts both players considerably

## Commitment and Comparison to 5
- commitment ... would be something like being crazy in experiment 5
	- strategic move of removing the steering wheel
		- player is now unable to steer away such that the other player is forced to steer to avoid certain destruction
	- similar to the doomsday machine which we also watched a video on

## Analyze data
- crash ratio:
	- crash ratio of crashes in random distribution: 25% (1/4)
	- crash ratio in experiment: 21.5% -> indicates more risk averse than if picked randomly
- profit ratio:
	- profit ratio in random distribution: 50% (1/4 + 1/4)
	- profit ratio in experiment: 52.7% -> indicates players which took advantage of risk aversion of other players
- overall stay decisions per round (out of 62)
	- 1: 30, 2: 31, 3: 28 (symmetric each round)
	- about half of individual decisions was to stay
- profit per round
	- 1: -800, 2: -1800, 3: -1400 (must by symmetric too)
	- hypothesis
		- by pure chance in round 2 the non-steering players were matched
		- stay/steer decisions mostly unchanged through all rounds
