# Confirmation Bias
- seeking confirming information
	- Lindholm & Christianson (1998) (n = 92)
	- rather blame innocent immigrant for crime than innocent own folk
		- only within own folk, not within immigrants
- how to circumvent:
	- switch perspective: what if x is the other way round, can be astonishing

# Influence of Schemas
- bank robbery: schema relevant information is seen, the rest not
	- Tuckey & Brewer (2003) (n = 106)
	- color of gun is seen, color of getaway car is not
	- replication study: even with a ski mask the gender of the robber is mostly male
- who is smart? 
	- Darley & Gross 1983 (n = 70)
	- social class has impact on memories of individual
	- seeing Hannah in the poor environment changes the memory of her test score negatively

# Misinformation Effect
- asking a different question changes the outcome (Loftus & Palmer 1974)
	- cars have smashed/collided/bumped/hit/contacted
	- collided/crashed cars were faster 
- telling people what happened makes them confirm a memory
	- even negative memories
		- 70% can report on false memory of having police contact in adolesence (Shaw & Porter 2015)
- misinformation can "create" memories which never happened
	- making up that one has visited Disneyland in childhood (Braun et al 2002) 

# Salience
- extent to which knowledge is activated in memory, thus likely to be used in cognition and behavior
- e.g. weapon focus effect

# Counterfactual Thinking
- Medvec, Madey & Gilovich (1995)
	- 3rd on podium is happy ... made it onto the podium
	- 2nd on podium is unhappy ... did not get 1st place

- overconfidence
	- overestimating accuracy of memories or predictors
	- eyewitness testimonies
		- small correlation of accuracy and confidence in memory
		- just because eyewitness is more "sure" it is not more likely to be correct
- [[Overestimation vs Overplacement vs Overprecision]]

- Moore & Healy (2008)
	- n = 82
	- overconfidence in simple tasks, too little confidence in complex/difficult tasks
		- reminds he of "you overestimate what you can do in a year, but underestimate what you can do in 10 years"
	- can you program? -> not confident enough, thinking they are worse than others
	- can you use a computer mouse? -> too confident, thinking they are better than others

- overconfidence & exams
	- Miller & Geraci (2011)
	- n = 113
	- top half of students have better predictions about their performance
		- but also higher confidence
	- [[Quasi Experiment]] bc we cannot change the confidence of the students
