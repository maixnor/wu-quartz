# Compounding
- prior [[knowledge]] helps to organize memory during encoding
	- also neiche/weird knowldege helps
	- [[Compound Interest]] of knowledge, learn a lot early and you will have an easier time your whole life

# Levels
- shallow (graphemic) processing
	- repeating
	- e.g. decide if a word is upper or lower case
- middle phonetic processing
	- e.g. decide if a word rhymes with a target word
- deep semantic processing
	- connecting to previous information
	- e.g. decide whether each word fits the blank in a sentence

## Strategies for Remembering
- don't just repeat information, elaborate upon it
- rather ask GPT questions about the lecture instead of just repeating slides
	- or let GPT ask you questions
	- change of perspective helps (e.g. teach instead of learn)
