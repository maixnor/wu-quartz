CEO of Black Rock

## 2022 Letter to the CEO
> We are on the edge of a fundamental reshaping of finance

> A company cannot achieve long-term profits without
embracing purpose and considering the needs of a
broad range of stakeholders.

> We believe that all investors need a clearer picture of
how companies are managing sustainability-related
questions

> In the near future – and sooner than most anticipate
– there will be a significant reallocation of capital
