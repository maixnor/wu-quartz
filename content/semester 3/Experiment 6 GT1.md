- [[Stackelberg Model]] competition is essence
- but simultaneous -> [[Cournot Model]]
	- no [[First Mover Advantage]] anymore
- commitment to best strategy ($Q_1$ = 500) is not valid anymore
	- commitment is only cheap talk
	- [[Extensive Form#Information Sets|Information Set]] around P1 and P2 choices
	- equilibrium is not dependent on P1's anymore
- [[Nash Equilibrium]] shifts from 500/250 to 333/333
- many first movers wanted to "cheat" by committing to 600, then changing to something lower

- I can make [[#DS Experiment 5]] into 6 by P2 not looking at the commitment P1 has done
	- also from [[Stackelberg Model]] to [[Cournot Model]]

## Math Expressions
- $\Pi_{2}= P * Q^{*} = (1-0.0001(Q_{1} + Q_{2})) * Q_{2}$
	- maximize -> [[Optimization]]
	- $Q_{2}^{*} = 500 - Q_{1}$
- $\Pi_{1}= P * Q^{*} = (1-0.0001(Q_{1} + Q_{2})) * Q_{1}$
	- maximize -> [[Optimization]]
	- $Q_{1}^{*} = 500 - Q_{2}$
- [[Nash Equilibrium]] at 333/333
