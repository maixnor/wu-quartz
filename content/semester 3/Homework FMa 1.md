- Taxes Decrease, so Disposable income increases, so Consumption increases, Demand Increases, Income Increases, loop
- equilibrium shifts from point E to F

## Multiplier Effect
- since the Y function is sloped less than the reference line $y=x$ every increase in income $Y$ has a larger increase in $Z$. This is due to the fact that the propensity to consume is usually between 0 and 1, such that in the formula: $\frac{c_{1}}{1 - c_{1}}$ where $c_{1}$ is the propensity to consume, the multiplicatory factory is greater than 1
