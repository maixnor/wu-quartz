- Taxes Decrease, so Disposable income increases, so Consumption increases, Demand Increases, Income Increases, loop
- equilibrium shifts from point E to F

## Multiplier Effect
- since the Y function is sloped less than the reference line $y=x$ every increase in income $Y$ has a larger increase in $Z$. This is due to the fact that the propensity to consume is usually between 0 and 1, such that in the formula: $\frac{c_{1}}{1 - c_{1}}$ where $c_{1}$ is the propensity to consume, the multiplicatory factory is greater than 1

## a) nominal vs real
- nominal interest rate is always measured in current units of currency
- downside: inflation is not taken into account with nominal interest rate
- real interest rate always references a fixed price level in the past such that interest rates can be compared without inflation. This is done by discounting for the inflation of the past

## b) investment and consumption decisions
- only the real interest rate is of interest
