## Experiment 14
- infinite repeated game
- no [[Backward Induction]] possible - there is no last round to roll back from
- any round is equal, probability of each run being the last round is the same
- NE of 0.08/0.08 still valid
	- subgames look line the actual game, i.e. no real subgames
- important factors:
	- fixed [[Discounting]] factor $\delta$ .... $\sum\limits^{\infty}_{t=1} \delta^{t} = \frac{\delta}{1-\delta}$
	- continuation probability
