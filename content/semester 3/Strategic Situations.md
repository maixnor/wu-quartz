# Definition Strategic Situation
> - what is best for me depends on the others are doing
> - what is best for others depends on what I am doing
## Implications
- complex dynamics
	- I know
	- they know, I know
	- I know, they know, I know,
	- ...
- outcomes are different
- agents are players
- interaction called "game"
# Definition Strategy
> - strategy = information + reaction
> - complete plan of action
- in business: a plan to achieve an organizations goals and objectives from which - ideally - each person can derive their own smaller goals
- strategy is a complete plan of action for a game
	- simple with rock/paper/scissors
	- harder with chess
- at every point in the game we know what to do
## Conditions
- time of action
- outcome of nature moves (random events)
- new information arriving
- observed actions of other agents
## Develop a good Strategy
- think about
	- rules of interaction
	- strategies/actions available to other players
	- role of nature/randomness
	- value of information
- think about your best action
	- at each point in time
	- in each state of the world
	- for each move of other players
- **write it down**
	- forces the brain to think clear thoughts
