I searched for short youtube videos, they explain it 10x better than I ever could.
# Bit and Byte
- [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZL-LhaaMTTE) explains decimal and hexadecimal very well
	- octal would be base 8 (not exam relevant)
- RGB values are split into 3 parts 
	- `#58A68F` -> `58` red, `A6` green, `8F` blue
## Floating Point Numbers
- Check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZRI1IfStY0) from computerphile, they explain it very well
- [this other video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljRojiI3E3E) is a lot faster but requires I'd say a good idea of binary to grasp
