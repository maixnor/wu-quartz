I searched for short youtube videos, they explain it 10x better than I ever could.
# Bit and Byte
- [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZL-LhaaMTTE) explains decimal and hexadecimal very well
	- octal would be base 8 (not exam relevant)
- RGB values are split into 3 parts 
	- `#58A68F` -> `58` red, `A6` green, `8F` blue
## Floating Point Numbers
- Check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZRI1IfStY0) from computerphile, they explain it very well
- [this other video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljRojiI3E3E) is a lot faster but requires I'd say a good idea of binary to grasp

# Data Types
- boolean
- int
- float (double)
- string

# Data Structures
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQWr9DFE1ww
	- not just the BA1 data structures, still very useful

- Array
- List/Vector
- Matrix
	- Array of Arrays
- Dataframe
	- Matrix but with multiple data types
	- imagine matrix meets excel sheet, but programmatically
- Graph

# Modelling
