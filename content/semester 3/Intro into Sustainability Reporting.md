- check multiple ratings, not just one

## Reasons to disclose
- voluntary disclosure theory
	- disclosure is a cost-benefit situation
	- firms should have incentive to disclose since customers are more likely to buy from them
	- without any disclosure costs they are ever clearly incentivized
	- "creating value from nothing"
		- if one is undervalued one can increase share value that way
- stakeholder theory
