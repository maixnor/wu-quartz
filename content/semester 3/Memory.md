# Definition Memory
> Memory refers to the psychological processes of acquiring, storing, retaining, and later retrieving information. There are three major processes involved in memory: encoding, storage, and retrieval.

> Usually, “memories” tends to refer to events recalled from the past, which are seen as more representational and subjective. In contrast, “memory” now is used to refer to the storage of information in general, including in DNA, digital information storage, and neuro-chemical processes. Today, science has moved far beyond a popular understanding of memory as fixed, subjective, and personal. In the extended definition, it is simply the capacity to store and retrieve information.

- Information which is stored by you to be retrieved later
	- can be on your computer or your genes too
- without memory one cannot live
	- recognizing locations and people
	- how to move

# Working Memory
 ![[memory.png]]
- goal is getting everything into long-term memory
	- effortless
- working-memory takes effort
- all of those parts can be blocked
	- [[Chess Player Distractions]]
- central executive
	- what to pay attention to?
	- CPU/scheduling tasks
	- demanding tasks
		- e.g. chess
- visuo-spational sketchpad
	- close your eyes, imagine an apple
- phonological loop
	- the "inner voice"
	- easier to remember phonetically dissimilar words than similar words
- episodic buffer
	- reason for a terrible theory
		- eliminates a chance of falsifyability
	- "does everything not done by the others"

# Differences
## Declarative / Explicit
- #todo
- episodic memory
	- storage for facts
		- e.g. how tall is a penguin?
	- developed rather late in evolution
		- kids get that later than other capabilities, old people lose it quite early
- semantic memory
	- general knowledge
		- e.g. language
	- unlimited capacity
		- BUT we don't learn everything we see
		- BUT we cannot retrieve everything
	- applications
		- learn a new language
		- study for an exam

## Non-Declarative / Implicit
- procedural memory
	- e.g. cycling
- priming 
	- recognition
		- e.g. bird vs cat
			- when shown the bird first the bird parts of your brain are activated
			- when then shown a cat with the outline of a bird
