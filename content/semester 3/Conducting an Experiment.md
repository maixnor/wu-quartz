# Data
- surveys
	- careful with personal identification
	- form brackets rather than actual values -> less identifiable
	- e.g. 
- company data
	- data which the company has anyway
	- e.g. amount of sick days
- empirical data
	- e.g. heart rate, skin conductivity
## What to measure
- control group vs treatment group
## When to measure
- before vs after experiment
# Participants
- anything with a social flavor in the experiment will be different in a different region
- practical problem: there is little variance with the participants
# Results
- again [[Correlation vs Causation]]
- [[Inference Problems]]
	- time plots are not enough
	- a [[Counter Factual]] is needed
	- also multiple samples are not better than single samples
		- more robust, just not solving the missing counter factual 
# Potential Solutions for Missing Counter Factuals
- [[Counter Factual]]
- Propensity Score Matching (PSM)
- Instrumental Variables (IV)
- Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD)
	- difference between birthday at 31st August and 1st September is just 1 day
	- but one gets in the school system directly, the other waits for another year
- Difference in Difference (DiD)

# Experiment Types
- [[Qualitative Research]]
	- becomes more quantitative since the invention of LLMs
- [[Correlation Studies]]
	- [[Survey Design]]
