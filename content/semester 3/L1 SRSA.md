		- [[Materiality Assesment]]
		- stakeholder communication -> [[Legitimacy Theory]]

- reputation and brand enhancement
- operational efficiency and cost savings
	- is already captured by the companies themselves - not necessary to be included in CSR
	- resources optimization
	- innovation stimulation
- risk management
	- not driving business actively -> more of a hygiene factor -> [[Herzberg Theory]]
	- identifying risks
	- regulatory compliance
- access to capital
	- no tangible difference in cost of capital based on ESG score
		- no penalties yet based on ESG score
	- impact on future cash flows -> future customers care (hopefully) more about sustainability 
	- sustainable financing
	- lower cost of capital
- competitive advantage
	- market differentiation
	- supply chain preference
- influence on corporate strategy
	- long-term planning -> [[Strategic Foresight]], [[Scenario Planning]]

	- talent acquisition
- challenges and costs
	- resource allocation
	- increased scrutiny
	- disclosure of sensitive information
- stakeholder pressure and activism
	- investor activism
	- management accountability
- legal and ethical compliance
	- companies are not ethical by definition - they want to make money
		- after Kant - moral = no goal
	- the tone at the top is very important
	- ethical standards
	- legal protection
- global standards alignment
	- international recognition
	- cross-border operations
- performance measurement and improvement
	- help by LLMs -> turning qualitative into quantitive
	- benchmarking
	- continuous improvement

## Reptation
- reputation is most important good
	- activism and public opinion (also through share value) can build pressure - legislation not so much
