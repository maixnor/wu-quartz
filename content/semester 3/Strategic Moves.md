> Action which changes the Game

- e.g. change in payoff matrix, available strategies

## Commitment
- commitment is one of such moves
	- must be credible
		- clear to understand
		- public
		- irreversible
	- works against rational players only
		- crazy players might still go beyond and trigger your commitment
	- e.g. doomsday machine: a bomb which triggers as soon as the country is attacked with no way to turn it off
