But why?

The answer to that question is: a bunch of smart people said 2% is good.

It's not a hard rule but rather a guideline for central banks to issue [[monetary policy]].

From historic analysis an inflation rate of about 2% balances 
- inflation and economic growth
- unemployment
- deflation security
pretty well.

2% is a also a global consensus, signaling to other countries or central banks that you know your stuff. 

### What the ECB says
> An inflation rate of 2% ensures price stability and supports the ECBâ€™s goals by preventing deflation risks and maintaining effective monetary policy. It allows for smoother economic adjustments, prevents excessive unemployment, and addresses potential biases in price measurement.
