# Normal Distribution
- probability of a single point is always 0
	- probability of randomly hitting a single point on a dart board is 0
- we can take a very small range around a point
	- probability of randomly hitting the bulls eye on a dart board is small, but not 0
- whether we can be certain that the result is "useful" we can work with the standard deviation $\sigma^2$
