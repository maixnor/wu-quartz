# Mundell-Fleming model
- [[Mundell-Fleming Model]]
- assumptions: 
	- prices are constant, both domestic and foreign prices
	- no inflation -> can use nominal instead of real interest rate
	- can use nominal exchange rate rather than real exchange rate
- higher exchange rate ... less exports
	- if my goods become more expensive via exchange rate the world will buy less
