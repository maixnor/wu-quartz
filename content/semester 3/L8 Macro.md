# Excess Exports
- savings increase - but not within own economy, in foreign economies
	- Trump: USA is deeply endebted, especially to China
		- is a problem to Trump and an argument in his campaign
- foreign wealth increases with excess exports
- less wealth within own economy
	- leads to deterioration of country, see Deutsche Bahn

# Mundell-Fleming model
- [[Mundell-Fleming Model]]
- assumptions: 
	- prices are constant, both domestic and foreign prices
	- no inflation -> can use nominal instead of real interest rate
	- can use nominal exchange rate rather than real exchange rate
	- domestic currency is only demanded within own country
		- counter example: USD in series Narcos
- higher interest rate -> higher exchange rate ... less exports
	- if my goods become more expensive via exchange rate the world will buy less
- [[Interest Parity Condition]]
- change in expected interest rate (and therefore exchange rate) immediately affect attractiveness of domestic assets
	- expected increase in exchange rate -> more attractive domestically
	- expected decrease in exchange rate -> less attractive domestically
	- buying a 10-year bond involves a lot of expectations 
- changes in IS curve have no change on mundell-fleming model
	- but the [[DD-curve]] still affects the net exports
		- higher Y -> you are richer -> more imports

## Fiscal Policy
#slides 
#todo 
- more government spending -> larger Y -> more exports
- government spending wants to stabilize own economy
	- when just increasing government spending customers can also buy/invest into foreign products -> money leaves country
	- how to circumvent that?
		- more gov spending together with tariffs -> domestic more attractive
		- targeting domestic producers/products
			- e.g. restaurant vouchers, reparaturbonus
