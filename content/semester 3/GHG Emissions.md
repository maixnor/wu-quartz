# Scopes
## Scope 1
- direct emissions
	- directly caused by company by burning of fossil fuels
	- e.g. steel production, company cars, combustion generator in the basement
## Scope 2
- direct energy consumption
	- e.g. electricity consumption, Fernwaerme, cooling, steam
## Scope 3
- indirect emissions
	- bought in / [[Supply Chain]]
	- e.g. employee travel (flights)
### Upstream
- purchased goods
- capital goods
- fuel and energy related activities
- waste generated in operations
- business travel
- employee commuting
- upstream leased assets
### Downstream
- downstream transportation and distribution
- processing of sold products
- use of sold products
	- e.g. company selling diesel generators 
- end-of-life treatment of sold products
	- important for electric cars
- downstream leased assets
- franchises
- investments

# How they are important
- most companies have high [[#Scope 3]] emissions
	- therefore push to sustainability standards
