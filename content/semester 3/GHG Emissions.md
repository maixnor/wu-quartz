# Scopes
- scopes have not been introduced to avoid [[double counting]] of emissions

## Scope 1
- direct emissions
	- directly caused by company by burning of fossil fuels
	- e.g. steel production, company cars, combustion generator in the basement
## Scope 2
- direct energy consumption
	- e.g. electricity consumption, Fernwaerme, cooling, steam
## Scope 3
- indirect emissions
	- bought in / [[Supply Chain]]
	- e.g. employee travel (flights)
- scope 3 cannot be calculated directly
	- information has to be given from suppliers
	- some suppliers don't even have that data

### Upstream
- purchased goods
- capital goods
- fuel and energy related activities
- waste generated in operations
- business travel
- employee commuting
- upstream leased assets
### Downstream
- downstream transportation and distribution
- processing of sold products
- use of sold products
	- e.g. company selling diesel generators 
- end-of-life treatment of sold products
	- important for electric cars
- downstream leased assets
- franchises
- investments

# How they are important
- most companies have high [[#Scope 3]] emissions
	- therefore push to sustainability standards

# But there is more than CO2
- reporting only done in CO2eq
- if there are other greenhouse gases (e.g. methane) they are translated into the equivalent CO2 amount
	- multiply by global warming potential
		- e.g. currently x27 for methane CH4, x273 for nitrous oxide N2O
- they are added up to be just 1 CO2 amount
	- possible to have 0 actual CO2 emissions but still report high CO2 emissions which are translated methane
