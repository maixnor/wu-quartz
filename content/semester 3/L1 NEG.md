# Pre-Assignment
- who are you negotiating for? your customer/yourself/your friend
	- mostly people negotiate for themselves, even tho they appear to negotiate for someone else
		- e.g. real estate agents

# Recap Game Theory

## Fixed Pie Bargaining
- only a fixed size pie available
	- no win-win outcomes
	- my win, their loss and vice versa
- [[Dictator Game]], [[Ultimatum Game]]
- preferences matter
	- is there more than money which is important?
	- fairness, reputation, promises, etc
- repetition matters
	- [[Repeated Ultimatum Game]]
	- [[Backward Induction]]
	- "you always meet twice in life"
- competition matters
	- [[Market Game]]
		- power from offering to accepting side
	- adding just a single party on one side changes everything to the opposing side
	- you are "priced" at your [[Opportunity Cost]]

# Case Study: One-Issue Negotiation
- [[BATNA]] - best alternative to negotiated agreement
	- the better the [[BATNA]] the stronger your [[bargaining power]]
	- in game theory called: "outside option"
- ZOPA - 
- [[Principle-Agent Problem]]

# Game Theory: Bargaining
## Asymmetric Information
- [[Open Book Accounting]]
- Cummnication
	- Cheap Talk works
		- works better than expected
		- most people buy into cheap talk, even tho it should not change anything about the negotiation terms
	- credible information is almost as effective as cheap talk, 
		- works less than expected

## Patience
- patience ... aversion against delays
- [[Rubinstein Bargaining Model]]
	- value of patience 0 < p < 1 ... [[Discounting]] value
	- kind of a [[Repeated Ultimatum Game]], but with discounting
	- ex: $p_{1}= 0.5, p_{2} = 0.9 \Longrightarrow d_{1}=0.18, d_{2}=0.82$
	- as patience increases the split converges to 50/50
	- with lower patience the [[first mover advantage]] is stronger
		- with higher patience the [[first mover advantage]] is weaker
	-
