# Reliability
- precision of measurements
- reliability = absence of measurement error

### Measure Reliability
- Test-Retest method
- split-half method
- inter-class correlation

# Validity
- do we measure what we want to measure
- validity = fit between underlying construct and the measure

### Internal vs External Validity
- internal ... truth in the study
	- are we doing the right thing in our experiment?
- external ... truth in real life
	- can we generalize the findings to the whole population?
