# Reliability
- precision of measurements
- reliability = absence of measurement error

### Measure Reliability
- Test-Retest method
- split-half method
- inter-class correlation

# Validity
- do we measure what we want to measure
- validity = fit between underlying construct and the measure

### Internal vs External Validity
- internal ... truth in the study
	- are we doing the right thing in our [[experiment]]?
- external ... truth in real life
	- can we generalize the findings to the whole population?
- usually a tradeoff between internal and external validity 

### Threats
- internal
	- failure to randomize
	- failure to follow treatment protocol -> [[IV Regression]]
	- attrition (dropping out of experiment)
	- [[Hawthorne]] effect
- external
	- non-representative sample (cannot infer from sample to population)
	- general equilibrium effects (factors/interaction which are not included in the model)
	- manna from heaven (earned vs given money)
