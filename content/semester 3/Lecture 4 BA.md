# Reduce Variables
- method to analyze: PCA
- in correlation matrix check for $0.3 < r < 0.9$
- bortletts test
	- $H_{0}$ follows identity matrix $I$

# Rotating Data
- e.g. flip sign of y-values 
	- points above x-axis go below and vice versa
- normally rotating 90 degrees
- can also be different degrees
	- especially helpful if psychological effects are included in data
