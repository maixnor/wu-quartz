# Quotes
> An attitude is a mental and neural state of readiness, organized through experience, exerting a directive or dynamic influence upon the individual's response to all objects and situations with which it is related. (Allport, 1935)

> Preferences thus imply all-things-considered-rankings, which consist of the chooserâ€™s overall evaluation of the object over which preferences are defined. This implies a ranking of those objects with respect to everything that matters to the agent: desirability, social norms, moral principles, habits - everything relevant to the evaluation. (Harper, Randall & Sharro, 2016)

> An attitude is an internal state of preparation (Spencer & Bain, 1980s)

- attitude is only a state of readiness, not the actual action taking
# Person or Situation
- genetic makeup
	- there is a gene to define how well you can naturally separate sounds
		- therefore it is hard to be in larger groups
		- therefore those people choose more selective groups
- maternal behavior and perceived sex of an infant
	- Smith & Lloyd 1978
	- 2x2x2 factorial design
	- why is our sample not significant?
		- samples size (n=20) too small (n>80 recommended)
	- difference in behavior of adults based on sex of infant
		- adults told if boy/girl and therefore different behavior/toy selection

# Components of Attitudes
### Cognitive
- factual knowledge

### Affective
- liking, emotional response

### Behavioral
- behavior towards something
- we see how we like/dislike something

## Snake Example
- 2 different scales
	- one regarding feelings, the other about cognitive characteristics
	- finding out about yourself if there is more bias towards feelings or cognition
- if we did the same scale with vacuum cleaners it would be different

## Explicit vs Implicit
- explicit = tip of the iceberg
	- cognitively accessible
	- more dynamic and can change over time
	- can be measured directly
- implicit = entirety of iceberg
	- outside of conscious awareness
	- automatically and always active
	- developed through experiences
	- also called [[Blindspots]]
		- day-to-day decision making
	- indirect measurements needed

# Changing Attitudes
- attidudional stability ... consistency over time

## Conditioning
- [[Conditioning]]

# Theory of Planned Behavior
- behavioral intention =
	- attitude toward the behavior
	- + subjective norms
		- e.g. [[peer pressure]]
	- + perceived [[behavioral control]]
- actual behavior results from this

# Accessibility
- deliberate behavior vs spontaneous behavior
- accessible
	- spontaneous decisions & behavior
- inaccessible
	- thinking about issue deeper and for longer
	- "hidden" attitudes influence decision

# Predictability
- specific attitudes are better predictors of behavior
- find a very specific attitude and ask about that rather than a larger topic/attitude
- Example Birth Control:

# Persuasion
- often used in marketing
- peripheral route vs central route
- peripheral route
	- brief communication
	- focus on main characteristics
		- expert? attractiveness?
	- temporary override of preference
	- e.g. flyer handed out in front of WU
- central route
	- elaborate communication
	- facts, logical soundness of arguments
	- attitude change for longer periods

## Yale Attitude Change Approach
### Who?
- wear glasses to seem more credible
- attractive speakers are better
- message is remembered longer than source
	- fact about unreliable source might be forgotten, leaving unreliable information which is believed to be reliable behind

### What?
- more persuaded by messages which seem to not be designed to influence them
- two-sided communication (pro+contra instead of just pro or contra)
- [[primacy effect]] vs [[recency effect]]
	- first person sets the stage -> remembered better
	- last person is remembered best (if not tired already)

### To Whom?
- distracted audiences are easy to persuade
- lower intelligence, moderate self-esteem, age 18-25
- cultural differences
	- western: personal relevance
	- other cultures: contextually relevant behavior
- I like it because it makes me feel good > I like it because others I am connected to like it

## Persuasion Immunity
### Attitude Inoculation
- thinking of counterarguments beforehand

### Awareness
- be aware of product placements
	- kids especially susceptible
- if people are forewarned they identify more product placements
	- more awareness => less persuasion

### Role Play
- extension of inoculation
- [[peer pressure]] can evoke attitude contrary behavior
- role-play helps to create situations in controlled environments
	- afterwards in real situation greater immunity
	- e.g. role-play with juveniles regarding smoking/drinking/sex

## Persuasion Backfire
- Pennebeaker & Sanders (1976)
	- more forbidden = more fun
- [[Reactance Theory]]
	- the more important the freedom, the more resistance
	- [[Covid]]: people felt threatened about own autonomy
	- "Do you like vegan beer?"
	- All Mensa food will be vegetarian from now on
- how to work around reactance?
	- creating incentives and counterincentives
		- e.g. making the meat dish more expansive than banning it alright
		- e.g. meat is an addon instead of included by default
	- labeling it as an experiment, but it is permament
		- e.g. Amesterdam blocking main road for cars
