# How to
- everyone has roles, either buyer or seller
	- buyers want to buy a smaller price than their value
	- sellers want to sell a higher price than their cost
	- no profit is better than a loss
- everyone can only trade once
# Analysis
- when all costs and values are known we can calculate the [[Nash Equilibrium]]
- economic theory works great here, the equilibrium price is mostly the average price of the [[experiment]]
