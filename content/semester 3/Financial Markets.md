## Fiscal Policy
- issued by government
- levels of government spending and taxes
	- also where the spending and taxing is happening

## Monetary Policy
- issued by central bank
- changes in money supply
	- setting [[Interest Rate]] for a region

# Market Operations
## Money Demand
- the amount of money people want to hold, aggregated
	- in personal finance: non-dispensable income
- dependent on income and [[Interest Rate]]
	- $M^{d} = M^{d}(Y, i)$

## Money Supply
- decided by central bank
- equilibrium = $M^{s} = M^{d}$
- therefore -> $M^{s} = Y * L(i)$

## Open Market Operations
- buying/selling own bonds
- increase money supply: expansionary open market operation
	- lower [[Interest Rate]]
	- buying of own bonds -> [[Share Buyback]], reducing available bonds
- decrease money supply: contractionary open market operation
	- higher [[Interest Rate]]
	- selling of own bonds -> issuing additional bonds
- no "setting" of [[interest rate]]
	- just selling/buying enough bonds to adjust interest rate accordingly
- interest rate increases when income $Y$ increases
- interest rate decrease when money supply $M^{s}$ increases
