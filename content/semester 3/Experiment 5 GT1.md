- [[Stackelberg Model]] competition
- sequential
	- start analysis with last mover (player 2)
- payoff table is not the normal form
	- strategies are horizontal "slides" which always funnel to the equilibrium in each row
	- strategy of player 2: $q_{2}= 500-0.5*q_1$
	- [[Nash Equilibrium]] at 500, 250
	- always true, unless [[Reputation]] says player 2 is crazy

## Math Expressions
- $\Pi_{2}= P * Q^{*} = (1-0.0001(Q_{1} + Q_{2})) * Q_{2}$
	- maximize -> [[Optimization]]
- $\Pi_{1}= P * Q^{*} = (1-0.0001(Q_{1} + 500-0.5Q_{1})) * Q_{1}$
	- maximize -> [[Optimization]]
