- why know about other standards?
	- different standards have different objectives
	- newer standards try to pluck flaws of other standards
		- what are these flaws?
	- no stock exchange has implemented the [[ESRS]] as a requirements
	- e.g. [[TCFD]] / [[TNFD]] is mandatory in Switzerland and UK
	- e.g. [[SASB]] is done in Northern America 
	- e.g. [[IFRS S]] is done in Turkey 
- [[GRI]] was the first standard

# Report Analysis
## Holcim
- [[TCFD]], and early adopters of [[TNFD]]
- materiality assessment? yes, [[double materiality]]
- topics prioritized? 
	- decarbonising efforts
		- especially more effective cement process
	- touching social issues
	- no industry-specific issues
- prescriptions
	- none, all are recommendations
- quantitative 
	- just [[GHG Emissions]] sector 1 and 2, 3 if possible
- qualitative 
	- governance, strategy, risk management, metrics and targets
