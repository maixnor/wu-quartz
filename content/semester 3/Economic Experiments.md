- [[Trading Pit]]

## Motivation
- test hypothesis
	- test and idea or model, find out how things work
- search for facts
	- study causal effects without having a model in mind first
- whisper in the ears of princess
	- make suggestions for changes based on data
	- test small & cheap interventions to decide which one to scale
- get right what others got wrong
	- disprove a wrong/weak work
	- gather further evidence for an insight

# Terminology
## Important
- control: the change between 2 groups
	- e.g. heels vs no heels
- factor levels:
	- 2 levels: heels vs no heels
	- 3 levels: <20, 20<22, >22
	- ...
	- n levels
- full factorial design
	- testing all combinations of factor levels
		- no theoretical limitation, but a practical limitation
- between-subject vs within-subject design
	- between: each treatment on different subjects
	- within: each subject gets different treatments
		- cheaper
		- have a look at [[#Repetition]]

## Tradeoffs
- possibility to study [[Interaction Effects]] 
	- how do different independent variables interact with one another
		- are heels more effective in summer than in winter?
- cost/feasibility
	- cannot add too many independent variables

## Repetition
- one-shot vs repeated game
