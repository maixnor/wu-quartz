- Don't be the first to set the initial offer
	- your reaction should reveal as little about your reservation price as possible
	- first offer really high, but not too high to blow the deal
- Make sure the agent acts in your interest
	- e.g. offer extra 1% provision if above higher than market value
- Cheap Talk works
	- most people buy into cheap talk, even tho it should not change anything about the negotiation terms
