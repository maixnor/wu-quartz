- most highly controlled method of [[hypothesis testing]]
- goal: Isolation of a [[Correlation vs Causation|cause-and-effect]] relationship
- independent variables (IVs) are predicted to impact the dependent variables (DVs)
- manipulation of IVs, then measurement of DVs while controlling all other confounding variables
- random assignment of participants to different conditions (= different versions of IVs)
	- e.g. treatment vs control group
	- identical groups
		- even tho people cannot be cloned we have statistical unbiased data
		- only applicable to larger sample sizes
			- how many people have long hair? sample size of 2. results: 100%, 50%, 0%
			- with higher sample size the results gets closer to reality
	- all same probably to be selected
		- e.g. [[Vietnam Lottery]]
	- no prior knowledge about [[unobservable information]] necessary
