# Part 1

## Assignment / Summary
_Benjamin engaged in a negotiation with the head of HR at Austrian Post AG regarding his salary and job title during his first corporate role. He initiated the discussion after feeling that his responsibilities far exceeded his age and pay level, creating a sense of being undervalued. Benjamin aimed to negotiate for a higher salary and a more prestigious job title, which he perceived as important at the time. The organizationâ€™s strict policies on salary negotiations limited his leverage, as agreements outside designated negotiation windows could delay future pay reviews by nearly two years. Additionally, the company held significant bargaining power, as Benjamin was new to the corporate environment and had limited experience navigating organizational dynamics. The negotiation was set against this backdrop of unequal power dynamics and restrictive policies._

## Answer
### Plan
- start off by listing responsibilities
	- use my technical expertise to snow job HR guy
	- compare to "market average responsibilities"
	- then let them make a first offer and highball them for 500E-1000E above their offer
- find people and voices to support me in the company
	- colleagues or a boss that speaks highly of me
	- internal letter of recommendation basically
- find definite selling points of my skills
	- or do something incredible the week before to show off my skills
- non-monetary options
	- willingness to work on the weekends or during the night in case of emergency -> cheap to me, valuable to Post
	- prestigious title (bogey)
		- first act like it's a big issue for me
		- then settle for same title with yet a higher pay


- befriend the HR people first
	- go out to lunch with them
	- never be aggressive during negotiations

- if all fails: chicken
	- "I will behave like a junior then, I will stuff I am assigned and go home"
	- willingness to work as a contractor instead of on their payroll or quit entirely for some other job
- if that fails too:
	- quiet quitting after some time

### Commentary
- BATNA low for Post, low for me -> not much bargaining power, but also not much power differences
	- for me hard to find another job
	- for Post hard to find skilled developer at that pay level
- both parties have high sunk cost - more power for me
	- Post: 3 salaries, 3 months of training me
	- Me: 3 months of wasted time with training I can't use elsewhere
	- still a bit less sunk cost for me
- sweeteners - more power to Post
	- Post has lots of sweeteners I don't want and can't exclude from my contract
		- food coupons nobody uses
		- bicycles nobody uses
		- other stuff nobody uses or values but still something they provide to create "value"

- away from positional to cooperative bargaining
	- don't start off with way too high salary and meet in the middle
	- only as second step after they have made a more reasonable offer
- company policies are just a trick - empty threat
- I would use snow job tactic since I have technical expertise
