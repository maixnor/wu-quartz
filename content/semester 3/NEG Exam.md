# Part 1

## Assignment
_Benjamin engaged in a negotiation with the head of HR at Austrian Post AG regarding his salary and job title during his first corporate role. He initiated the discussion after feeling that his responsibilities far exceeded his age and pay level, creating a sense of being undervalued. Benjamin aimed to negotiate for a higher salary and a more prestigious job title, which he perceived as important at the time. The organizationâ€™s strict policies on salary negotiations limited his leverage, as agreements outside designated negotiation windows could delay future pay reviews by nearly two years. Additionally, the company held significant bargaining power, as Benjamin was new to the corporate environment and had limited experience navigating organizational dynamics. The negotiation was set against this backdrop of unequal power dynamics and restrictive policies._

## Answer
### Plan
- start off by listing responsibilities
	- compare to "market average responsibilities"
- find people and voices to support me in the company
- find definite selling points of my skills
	- or do something incredible the week before to show off my skill
- use my technical expertise to snow job HR guy
- befriend the HR people first - never be aggressive

- if all fails: chicken
	- "I will behave like a junior then, I will stuff I am assigned and go home"
- willingness to work as a contractor instead of on their payroll or quit entirely

### Commentary
- BATNA low for Post, low for me -> not much bargaining power
	- for me hard to find another job
	- for Post hard to find skilled developer
- both parties have high sunk cost
	- Post: 3 salaries, 3 months of training me
	- Me: 3 months of wasted time with training I can't use elsewhere
- Post has lots of sweeteners I don't want
	- food coupons nobody uses
	- bicycles nobody uses
	- other stuff nobody uses or values but still something they provide to create "value"
- away from positional to cooperative bargaining
	- don't start off with way too high salary and meet in the middle
- company policies are just a trick - empty threat
- I could use snow job tactic since I am technical
