## Assignment
_Benjamin engaged in a negotiation with the head of HR at Austrian Post AG regarding his salary and job title during his first corporate role. He initiated the discussion after feeling that his responsibilities far exceeded his age and pay level, creating a sense of being undervalued. Benjamin aimed to negotiate for a higher salary and a more prestigious job title, which he perceived as important at the time. The organizationâ€™s strict policies on salary negotiations limited his leverage, as agreements outside designated negotiation windows could delay future pay reviews by nearly two years. Additionally, the company held significant bargaining power, as Benjamin was new to the corporate environment and had limited experience navigating organizational dynamics. The negotiation was set against this backdrop of unequal power dynamics and restrictive policies._
