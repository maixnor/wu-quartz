# Obstacles to change
- getting started
- impulsivity
	- consequences only later
- procrastination
- forgetfulness
- lack of motivation
- confidence (lack of)
- conformity

# Nudging
- leaders are choice architects
	- who gets how much remuneration
	- how many meetings are you doing and what about
- also public leaders like politicians are choice architects
- people love being asked for their opinion

> "any aspect of the choice architecture that alters people's behavior in a predictable way without forbidding any options or significantly changing their economic incentives"

## Choice architecture
- descriptions, procedures and other context factors
- [[Decoy Effect]]

## Predicted effect
- I want my nudge to do something

## Rationality Neutral
- [[Incentive Scheme]] stays the same, but the environment is changing
- decision maker has still autonomy
- a nudge is "easy and cheap to avoid"

## Ladder of interventions
- do nothing, just monitor
	- people feeling watched
- provide information
- enable choice
- changing the default option <- Nudging
- incentives (give money)
- disincentives (fines)
- restrict choice (harder)
- eliminate choice (impossible)

# Upsides
- we are great at comparing, not at pinpointing exact prices
- the default option is very important
	- any additional effort can be forgotten or not done at all

# Downsides
- descriptive norm ... what people are doing now
- injunctive norm ... what people are supposed to do

- effects are highly contextually
- effects might be tiny
- effects may not last
- backfiring may be possible

# Boosting
- creating competence, so people make better decisions for themselves
