# Techniques
- [[method of loci]]
	- shopping list: place objects in a memorable way at home
	- memory palace
	- better memory forming when more senses are included
		- smell, taste, sounds, touch
- chunking
	- 5 $\pm$ 2 can be retained easily
	- e.g. have 9 different people, actions and places in mind for numbers 0-9
		- a 3-digit number can be remembered by a person doing something in a specific place 
			- 10 people, actions, places have to be remembered/chosen for oneself only once - encoding from numbers to weird image
		- e.g. Einstein playing basketball at a coffee shop sticks better than 394
- acronyms and acrostics
- rhyming
- music mnemonics
	- e.g. ABC song

## Storytelling
- humans can better remember narratives than unordered numbers
	- should be weird/horrible/funny

## Empirical Evidence
- Bower & Clark (1969)
	- n = 24 ... not reliable enough
	- remember words from a list
		- control group nothing, experimental group with a story behind the words
	- after 12 lists: control median 13%, experimental median 93%
		- + less inter-list interference with experimental group
	- there is an 80% difference ... very fishy (too large difference with such a small sample)
