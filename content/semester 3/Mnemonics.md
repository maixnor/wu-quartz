- [[method of loci]]
	- place stuff in my home
	- memory palace
- chunking
	- 5 $\pm$ 2 can be retained easily
	- e.g. have 9 different people, actions and places in mind for numbers 0-9
		- a 3-digit number can be remembered by a person doing something in a specific place
		- e.g. Einstein playing basketball at a coffee shop sticks better than 394
- acronyms and acrostics
- rhyming
- music mnemonics
	- e.g. ABC song

- humans can better remember narratives than unordered numbers
	- should be weird/horrible/funny

- Bower & Clark (1969)
	- n = 24 ... not reliable enough
	- remember words from a list
		- control group nothing, experimental group with a story behind the words
	- after 12 lists: control median 13%, experimental median 93%
		- + less inter-list interference with experimental group
	- there is an 80% difference ... very fishy


- personal book recommendation if interested: Moonwalking with Einstein
