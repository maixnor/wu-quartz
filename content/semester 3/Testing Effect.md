> retrieval practice of material to-be-remebered during learning improves learning success (and more than subjectively expected)

- retrieval effort hypothesis
	- when retrieving memory there is a deeper trace than just reading
	- the harder it is to retrieve the longer it will stay in memory
		- the pathway is really strong
- can be used regardless of the material


- Roediger & Karpicke (2006)
	- n = 120
	- #todo slide 40/41
	- repeated study (4x)
	- simple recall (3x read, 1x recall)
	- multiple recall (1x read, 3x recall)
	- 5min after reading the 4x reading group was best
	- 1 week after reading the mulitple recall group was best
		- 50% better than repeated
		- recalling = long-term memory

- answer first or google first
	- n = 240
	- no-pretest group: immediately access to external information
	- pretest group: access to external information only later
	- asking the questions first primes the brain to take in the info
		- finding the correct questions to ask
