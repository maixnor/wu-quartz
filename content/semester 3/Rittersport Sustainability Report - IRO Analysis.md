# **Sustainability Reporting for Rittersport: IRO Analysis **

by Group 5 - Farkas Benedek, Horvat Zellhofer Paulina, Meixner Benjamin

## **Introduction**

This report presents the findings of an Impacts, Risks, and Opportunities (IRO) analysis conducted for a chocolate producer, focusing on sustainability matters. The analysis assesses the materiality of various environmental, social, and governance ([[ESG]]) factors, identifies key risks and opportunities, and highlights stakeholder perspectives. The objective is to provide a comprehensive overview that informs strategic sustainability initiatives and reporting efforts.

## **Materiality Assessment**

The materiality assessment employed a double materiality approach, evaluating both the financial implications and the broader environmental and social impacts of each sustainability matter. Key areas identified include climate change, water and marine resources, biodiversity, resource use and raw materials, workforce conditions, supply chain practices, community impact, consumer relations, business conduct, and management control.

Climate change and resource use emerged as significant factors, each rated highly in both impact and financial materiality. These areas are critical due to their direct influence on operational costs, supply chain stability, and long-term viability. Water management and biodiversity also hold considerable importance, given the chocolate producer’s dependence on water-intensive processes and the ecological footprint of cocoa cultivation.

Conversely, certain areas such as management and control, while still relevant, were assessed with slightly lower materiality ratings, reflecting their supportive role in the overall sustainability framework. Some matters, like specific aspects of governance, received minimal to informational rankings, indicating lower immediate impact but recognizing their foundational importance.
