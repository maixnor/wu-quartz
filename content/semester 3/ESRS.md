> "European Sustainability Reporting Standards"

# General
- standards written within a year by [[EFRAG]]
- medium quality standards (from [[FRA Financial Reporting and Analysis]])
	- too many inclarities
- sector specific standards postponed
	- 38 sector standards planned
	- 9 sector standards already defined
- in spirit is about
	- cross cutting standards
	- environmental matters
	- [[social matters]]
	- governance matters
- appendixes with relevant information
- sustainability statement part of normal management report, not it's own document
	- general information
	- environmental information
	- social information
	- governance information
- standard in [[EU]]
	- there are lots of drafts - careful when searching online
		- currently easy to see if a G2 is included, there is no G2 at the moment
- [[Double Materiality]]

## Different Books
- [[Materiality Assesment]]
- [[Value Chain]]
- List of ESRS datapoints
	- a huge excel sheet in essence
		- most companies report like that currently
	- [[Digital Tagging]]

## Different standards
- [[ESRS 1]] - general requirements (cross cutting across all sectors)
- [[ESRS 2]] - general disclosures (cross cutting across all sectors)

- [[E1]] - climate change
	- if climate change is not material a detailed explanation is necessary
	- others just are/aren't, no explanation required
- E2 - [[pollution]]
- E3 - water and marine resources
- E4 - biodiversity and ecosystems
- E5 - resource use and [[circular economy]]
- S1 - own workforces
- S2 - workers in [[value chain]]
- S3 - affected communities
- S4 - consumers
- G1 - business conduct

## Same Logic
- each standard has the same structure
- governance (GOV)
	- how the company is dealing with it
- strategy (SBM)
	- how it fits the overall strategy and business model of company
- IROs
	- as an example: [[Rittersport Sustainability Report - IRO Analysis]]
- Metrics and Targets
	- quanitative measures and goal definitions

## The Report
- requirements defined in [[ESRS 1]]
- disclosures defined in [[ESRS 2]]
### ESRS 2 IRO-1
- how did I gather the data for the report?
### ESRS 2 IRO-2
- what did I do for the data? 
- who did I ask for the data?
	- only internal/employees or also externals?
### ESRS 2 SBM
- how risks are mirrored in business model
- strategies how to handle risks
	- similar to [[Scenario Planning]]

# Interoperability
- basis is [[Digital Tagging]]
- [[GRI]] and [[ESRS]] are very similar
	- even joint statement possible
- [[IFRS SDS]] also mostly compatible
	- mapping table of [[ESRS]] matters to [[IFRS SDS]]
	- efforts to be more global and interoperable
