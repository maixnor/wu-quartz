- why know about other standards?
	- different standards have different objectives
	- newer standards try to pluck flaws of other standards
		- what are these flaws?
	- no stock exchange has implemented the [[ESRS]] as a requirements
	- e.g. [[TCFD]] / [[TNFD]] is mandatory in Switzerland and UK
	- e.g. [[SASB]] is done in Northern America 
	- e.g. [[IFRS SDS]] is done in Turkey 
- [[GRI]] was the first standard

- a lot of standards, hard to compare between them

- [[TCFD]], and early adopters of [[TNFD]]
- materiality assessment? yes, [[double materiality]]
- topics prioritized? 
	- decarbonising efforts
		- especially more effective cement process
	- touching social issues
	- no industry-specific issues
- prescriptions
	- none, all are recommendations
- quantitative 
	- just [[GHG Emissions]] sector 1 and 2, 3 if possible
- qualitative 
	- governance, strategy, risk management, metrics and targets

## 6 Addiko Bank 
- credit: group 6
* Addiko Bank uses the European Sustainability Reporting Standards ([[ESRS]]), aligned with the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive ([[CSRD]]). The report also fulfills the criteria outlined in the Austrian Sustainability and Diversity Improvement Act ([[NaDiVeG]]) 
* The report additionally reflects [[SASB]] standards and refers to the International Sustainability Standards Board for consumer finance and commercial banks 

Materiality assessment in the report:
* Addiko Bank conducted a [[double materiality]] assessment, which covers both impact materiality and financial materiality. 
* The [[double materiality]] approach evaluates **97 sustainability matters**, covering [[ESG]] issues 

Sustainability topics prioritized in the report:
* The key material topics identified for Addiko Bank include:
    * [[Climate Change]] ([[ESRS]] E1)
    * Own Workforce ([[ESRS]] S1)
    * Consumers and End-users (ESRS S4)
    * Business Conduct (ESRS G1) - These topics guide the bankâ€™s sustainability initiatives.
* Non-material topics for Addiko Bank include Pollution ([[ESRS]] E2), Water and Marine Resources ([[ESRS]] E3), Biodiversity and Ecosystems ([[ESRS]] E4), and Circular Economy ([[ESRS]] E5)

Governance disclosures under [[ESRS]] E1 require companies to describe the roles and responsibilities of their administrative, management, and supervisory bodies in managing climate-related issues. They must detail how these bodies oversee the sustainability-related performance, including climate risk management, and how sustainability is integrated into decision-making processes
(Governance requirements focus on the involvement of the company's board and management in overseeing climate-related risks and opportunities)

Strategy - The standard requires the disclosure of a transition plan for [[climate change]] mitigation. Companies must align their business models and strategies with global climate targets, especially the [[Paris Agreement]], and assess how [[climate risks]] interact with their business models and strategy

KPIs include specific measures such as Scope 1, 2, and 3 [[GHG emissions]], energy consumption, and progress towards renewable energy targets. 

Targets set under [[ESRS]] E1 must focus on [[climate change]] mitigation and adaptation, including specific [[GHG emissions]] reduction targets. Companies are required to disclose how they are progressing toward these targets.
