- almost [[Cartel]] competition - [[Price Matching Policy]]
	- signal of price matching: "You undercutting me does not benefit you"
- Collusion is now the Equilibrium
	- [[Dilemma Games]]
	- [[Nash Equilibrium]] at 80 cents for everyone (was 30 cents before)
- only me setting the price matching is not enough
	- price matching policy setter does not lose out, even if undercut
- if other player(s) set price matching equilibria change
	- many more equilibria
	- now about selecting the correct equilibrium
- if all players set price matching 
	- undercutting does not benefit anyone anymore
- why did undercutting happen even in groups will all players setting price matching?
	- irrationality
