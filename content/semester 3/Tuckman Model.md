1) Forming  
2) Storming  
3) Norming  
4) Performing  

# Explanation
- forming 
	- when forming there is some friction, but not as much yet since members still need to get to know each other
- storming
	- members get to know each other, find out about how they can work together more effectively
	- lots of trial and error, little productivity
- norming
	- people start cooperating well and strong dynamics are developing
	- the productivity rises quickly
- performing
	- members know exactly who they are working with and how each person works best
	- mutual support, little to no friction

# Practical Criticism
- when adding/removing members there is a second curve starting out which will behave the exact same but is at a different time in the progression
- it just takes some time for all people to adjust
- total productivity = 
	- productivity of previously established team
	- + productivity of established team + new people/person
- many overlapping graphs and summing them up is a more practical explanation than just a single line

# Conclusion
- this only works if teams exist as-is for larger durations (minimum 2 months) to get going
- ripping apart teams early because of "productivity" is not smart, especially if done repeatedly
- adding/removing a single member can throw everything off balance, tho a currently "perfroming" team will take it better/recover faster than a currently "norming" team
