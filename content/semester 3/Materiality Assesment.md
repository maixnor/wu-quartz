# Basics
- inputs
	- water consumption
	- working conditions
	- data protection
	- child labor
	- microplastics

- outputs
	- materiality list company needs to focus on
		- [[Double Materiality]]

- not done every year
	- business model does not change that quickly
	- usually every 2 years

# How To
## 1) Understanding Context
- stakeholders
	- upstream / downstream stakeholders
	- affected stakeholders
		- employees, suppliers
		- consumers, customers, end-users
	- users of sustainability statements
		- students, employees, investors, lenders etc
	- [[Silent Stakeholders]]
		- nature may be considered as silent stakeholders
		- e.g. endangered species, minorities/cultures

## 2) Find IROs
- [[Double Materiality#Impacts, Risks, Opportunities]]
- GROSS perspective
	- analyse risks despite of interventions/measures
	- e.g. flooding risk does not decrease bc I took measures for when a flooding happends
- breakdown by
	- country, location or asset, subsidiary, sector
- sustainability matters
	- [[ESRS#Different standards]]
		- [[E1]], E2, E3 and their sub-points 
		- e.g. E2 pollution - first 4 might be material, last 4 might not be material
	- also look at data points
- top-down vs bottom-up
	- parent first, subsidiary later (top-down)
	- subsidiary later, parent first (bottom-up)
	- parent and subsidiary are different
		- which materalities effect either group/parent or just individual subsidiaries
	- e.g. holding company with many different companies/sectors 

### Stakeholder Engagement
- how to ask/involve all/most stakeholders?
- survey employees, consumers, banks, suppliers
	- lot's of surveys currently (Nov 2024)
- interviews/group discussions
	- with most important customers/suppliers
- identify IROs based on that
- integrate and prioritize matters 

- benefits: better [[Strategic Foresight]] and [[Scenario Planning]] capabilities
	- better understanding of stakeholders and therefore better decisions
	- not purely better for environment, but also for company itself
	- also cheaper loans (Hummel/Jobst 2024 L3 p8)

## 3) Assess IROs
- score/rank IROs by stakeholder effect
- stakeholder engagement
- define thresholds
	- which topics should you report on
		- can be absolute or relative
			- i.e. top 10 issues is critical vs everything above 100k risk is critical
	- e.g. minimal, informative, important, significant, critical
