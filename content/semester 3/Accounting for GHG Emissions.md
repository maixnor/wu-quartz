# Why is it important?
- climate scientist underestimate recent warming effects
- extreme weather anomalies reaching higher than ever before
- Austria
	- average temperature deviation rising 
		- +2.6 degrees on average, more in cities than in mountains

# ESRS
- [[ESRS]] [[E1]]

# GHG Protocol Standards

# Corporate vs Product Carbon Footprint
- product carbon footprint
	- technically hard to calculate
- 2 different perspectives on the same emissions
	- e.g. apple, emissions of the whole company vs emissions per iPhone produced
	- not double-counting, since it is the same emissions, but different perspective
		- one could also argue everything is double counted...

# Generally Accepted GHG Accounting Principles
- relevance
	- report must reflect the actual emissions
- completeness
	- include all emissions
- consistency
	- consistency over time to allow for easy comparison
- transparency
	- data sources
	- assumptions
	- calculations
- accuracy
	- everything is an estimation
	- but the goal is to remove uncertainties and not over/underrepresent emissions

# GHG Accounting Process Steps
- get data
- decide on boundaries and calculation schemes
	- also dependent on data available
	- boundaries for organization and for operations
		- scopes 1, 2, 3 
- analyse data and calculate [[GHG Emissions]]
- stick to it and report correctly

## Setting Organizational Boundaries
- equity share approach
- control approach
	- if there is operational control the emissions of the controlled entity are 100% of the controlling entity

### Scope 1 Emissions
- identify sources
	- stationary/mobile combustion, fugitive emissions, process emissions
- select calculation approach
	- direct measurement, stoichiometric calculations, estimates
- collect data and choose emissions factors
	- mostly emission data is written on the invoice
	- just not integrated yet in the [[ERP system]] of most companies
		- would allow for integrated calculations
	- data levels
		- primary: consumption in liters of fuel
		- secondary: mileage of car
		- tertiary: amount spent on fuel
- apply calculation tool
	- convert all emissions to CO2eq
- roll-up data to corporate level

### Scope 2 Emissions
- identify sources
	- electricity, steam, heat, cooling
- select calculation approach
	- market based vs location based approach	
		- location ... geographic location
		- market ... contracts, purposeful decision
- collect data and choose emissions factors
	- metered electricity, utility bills
	- consumption in kWh
	- emissions per kWh from different energy providers
- apply calculation tools
	- convert all emissions into CO2eq
- roll-up data to corporate level

### Scope 3 Emissions
- GHG Protocol -> [[#GHG Protocol Standards]]
- screening
	- based on all 15 categories of [[GHG Protocol]]
	- identify significant categories based on estimated emissions
- calculation
	- calculate and estimate as best as possible
- update
	- update scope 3 every year
	- full inventory (scope 1 and 2 too) only every 3 years
		- or when significant change
- not include
	- emission offsetting / emission trading -> transparency
	- reflect actual emissions
#### Process
- describe the value chain
- data collection and initial assessment
	- supplier data
		- on invoice of supplier
	- hybrid data
	- average data (secondary process data)
		- e.g. aggregate miles of flights booked
	- spend-based data (tertiary accounting data)
		- e.g. aggregate of cost of flights booked
- materaility and screening -> [[Materiality Assesment]]
- selection of relevant categories
	- based on data collected
- selection of calculation methods and calculation
	- depends on data available
		- supplier-specific method
			- aggregate of all suppliers
		- hybrid method
			- aggregate of supplier data you have, extrapolate for the rest
		- average data method
			- take average of emissions per unit consumed you have, multiply by consumption 
		- spend-base method
			- take average of emissions per expenses you have, multiply by expenses
- results and interpretation

- compatibility with paris agreement
- decarbonization levers
	- emission reduction
- quantification of investments
	- climate change mitigation actions
- locked-in [[GHG Emissions]]
	- e.g. a new plant has been built 5 years ago which is running on gas-generators
