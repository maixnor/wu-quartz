# Why is it important?
- climate scientist underestimate recent warming effects
- extreme weather anomalies reaching higher than ever before
- Austria
	- average temperature deviation rising 
		- +2.6 degrees on average, more in cities than in mountains

# ESRS
- [[ESRS]] [[E1]]

# GHG Protocol Standards
- #todo

# Corporate vs Product Carbon Footprint
- #todo
- product carbon footprint
	- technically hard to calculate
- 2 different perspectives on the same emissions
	- e.g. apple, emissions of the whole company vs emissions per iPhone produced
	- not double-counting, since it is the same emissions

# Generally Accepted GHG Accounting Principles
#todo 
- relevance
- completeness
- consistency
- transparency
- accuracy
	- everything is an estimation
	- but the goal is to remove uncertainties and not over/underrepresent emissions

# Accounting Process Steps
#todo
- get data
- decide on boundaries and calculation schemes
	- also dependent on data available
- stick to it and report

## Setting Organizational Boundaries
- equity share approach
- control approach
	- if there is operational control the emissions of the controlled entity are 100% of the controlling entity

### Scope 1 Emissions
- identify sources
	- stationary/mobile combustion, fugitive emissions, process emissions
- select calculation approach
	- direct measurement, stoichiometric calculations, estimates
- collect data and choose emissions factors
	- mostly emission data is written on the invoice
	- just not integrated yet in the [[ERP system]] of most companies
		- would allow for integrated calculations
	- data levels
		- primary: consumption in liters of fuel
		- secondary: mileage of car
		- tertiary: amount spent on fuel
- apply calculation tools
- roll-up data to corporate level
