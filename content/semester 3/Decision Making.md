# Rationality
- assumptions:
	- unlimited cognitive resources
	- perfect information
	- utility maximization

## Realistic Decision Making
- don't have limitless cognitive capacity or willpower
- not entirely selfish
- psychological realism -> better predictability
- more realism is not always better
	- "all models are wrong, but some are better for what you need"
- problem of [[Unfalsifiability]] in psych models
	- not a problem in [[Realistic Decision Theory]]
- risky decision: optimize for expected value: 
- [[Knightean Uncertainty]] vs radical uncertainty (not knowing anything)

## Choice under Risk
- you know the outcomes and the percentages (lottery setting)
- not just expected value -> [[St Petersburg Paradox]]
- expected utility more important in decision making
	- utility is not a linear function, more like a log function
- not maximizing expected value, but expected utility
	- large gains should not be weighted as heavy as small gains

## 4 Axioms of Rational Behavior
- [[submodules/wu-quartz/content/John von Neumann|John von Neumann]] and [[Oskar Morgenstern]] as the beginnings of game theory
- completeness $A>B, B>A or A \sim B$
- transitivity $A < B \land B < C \implies A < C$
- continuity #todo 
- independence #todo
- we can find examples against all 4 axioms:
	- e.g. [[Allais Paradox]]

# Decision Making
- person vs situation
- #todo 

## Information Search
1. problem recognition
2. information search
	- internal (memories) vs external (research, availability)
	- active progressing is done in [[Memory#Working Memory Model|Working Memory]]
