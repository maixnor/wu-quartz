# Rationality
- assumptions:
	- unlimited cognitive resources
	- perfect information
	- utility maximization

## Realistic Decision Making
- don't have limitless cognitive capacity or willpower
- not entirely selfish
- psychological realism -> better predictability
- more realism is not always better
	- "all models are wrong, but some are better for what you need"
- problem of [[Unfalsifiability]] in psych models
	- not a problem in [[Realistic Decision Theory]]
- risky decision: optimize for expected value: 
- [[Knightean Uncertainty]] vs radical uncertainty (not knowing anything)

## Choice under Risk
- you know the outcomes and the percentages (lottery setting)
- not just expected value -> [[St Petersburg Paradox]]
- expected utility more important in decision making
	- utility is not a linear function, more like a log function
- not maximizing expected value, but expected utility
	- large gains should not be weighted as heavy as small gains

## 4 Axioms of Rational Behavior
- [[submodules/wu-quartz/content/John von Neumann|John von Neumann]] and [[Oskar Morgenstern]] as the beginnings of game theory
- completeness $A>B, B>A or A \sim B$
- transitivity $A < B \land B < C \implies A < C$
- continuity #todo 
- independence #todo
- we can find examples against all 4 axioms:
	- e.g. [[Allais Paradox]]

# Decision Making
- person vs situation
- #todo 

## Information Search
- 1 problem recognition
- 2 information search
	- internal (memories) vs external (research, availability)
	- active progressing is done in [[Memory#Working Memory Model|Working Memory]]

### Intuition
- intuition depends a lot on the information you have
	- shit in - shit out
- the better your inputs (memories, biases, etc) are the better your intuitions are the better decisions you will make
- if you have a bad (inaccurate) gut feeling you can change this with better inputs
- justification only after making a choice -> only looking for supporting evidence, not for counteracting arguments

### Indifference
- if choices are equal or only marginally different
- problem: infinite decision time, [[Buyers Remorse]]
- solution: picking randomly

### Others
- asking other people
- e.g. an export on the topic, a friend, a trusted individual
- just speaking it out changes a lot
- outsourcing: coin, person, algorithm, `/dev/random`

### Dealing with Limitations
- trade off between efficiency and accuracy (Simon, 1957)
- moral wriggle room (putting off a decision)
	- e.g. not opening the door to a salesman to say no

# Construction
- perception is influenced by
	- context factors
	- previous experiences
	- expectations
	- motivations
- framing
	- experienced entrepreneurs perceive less uncertainty and are less affected by framing issues

## Prospect Theory
- editing phase
	- simplify decisions (cutting off branches of decision tree)
	- reduce consideration set
	- cancelling options out or simplifying
- evaluation phase
	- consider values relative to one another
	- consideration of probabilities
- value of losses weighted more than value of losses
	- utility function is not linear
	- [[Marginal Changes]] appear with gains and losses
- value is rather wealth changes, not absolute wealth level
- risk-averse for gains, risk-seeking for losses
	- gambling addiction
- probability weighting
	- overweighting low probabilities, underweighting high probabilities
	- overestimate luck, good and bad
	- certainty (say 1%, 99%) are undervalued

# Heuristics
> Mental shortcuts to make judgement quickly and efficiently.

&amp; Aronson el al. 2019, p. 64

- most of the time heuristics are great
- [[Cognitive Bias Codex]]

## Availability
- if you think of it, it must be important
- not as many people die from shark attacks as from lightning strikes
- but people are worried more of sharks, because they can think of it
- if availability is good or not depends on what your sample is
- emotional events will be more available
- problematic implications:
	- anything that is not available is not regarded
	- distortion or abuse of public order
	- bad allocation of funds

## Insensitivity to Sample Size Bias
- failing to appreciate role of sample size

## Conjunction Fallacy
- an and gate can only ever reduce the probability
- "certain" combinations are considered more probable than the individual factors, although it can only be more probable

## Confirmation Bias
- accepting supporting data as is
- trying to reject disproving data
- "You see what you expect to see"
- [[Dissonance]]
- remedy: [[Devils Advocate]], outside counsel
- dark side of dissonance:
	- escalation of commitment
	- sunk cost fallacy
	- irrational ignorance towards relevant information
	- ethical dissonance
	- overweighting of expensive advise
	- discounting of feedback 
		- just because a bad person said a good thing does not make it bad
	- absenteeism
	- resistance to change

### Examples Confirmation Bias
- thinking a university course is bad, then you perceive it as bad even though you would like otherwise if not told that before

## Anchoring
- #todo
- price set in beginning is really important
