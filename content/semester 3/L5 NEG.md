# Closing the deal
- provide alternatives
	- works great with kids
	- if they have the feeling the deal is closed they are more likely to agree
- assume the close
	- "shall I start the paperwork"?
- split the difference
	- stop by "fair" meeting in the middle
- exploding offers
	- create strong time pressure
	- "by tonight you agree or you don't"
- sweeteners
	- save something special for the end of the deal
	- e.g. winter tires
