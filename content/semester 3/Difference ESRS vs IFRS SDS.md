- [[ESRS]] vs [[IFRS SDS]]
	- [[ISSB]] taking care of [[IFRS SDS]] is also thinking about Asia, not just European like the [[EFRAG]]
	- [[IFRS SDS]] is again about delivering information to investors and creditors, rather than the public or the government
- [[ESRS]] can be seen as superset of [[IFRS SDS]]
	- ESRS is a lot more more in-depth
	- only [[ESRS]]:
		- [[Double Materiality]]
		- social standards
- Substituatibility
	- if a company applies one of them also providing the other it is easy
	- if you already publish information on either - the other is not far off
- Value Chain Compatibility
	- a company reporting in [[IFRS SDS]] should not have a hard time giving information to a company reporting with [[ESRS]] and vice versa to support trans-supranational trade
