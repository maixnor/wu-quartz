[[L2 SRSA]] - only the parts we covered are relevant for the exam
[[L4 SRSA]]
[[L5 SRSA]]

# Exam
- single choice (similar to quiz we had)
- + open end (checking for understanding, not learning by heart)
	- e.g.: what is the difference between [[ESRS]] and [[IFRS SDS]] 
- content: 
	- all slides + all case study material
	- + details from KPMG experts on Wednesday (20240115)

- Slide 116! Perfect question there regarding financial and impact materiality
	- maybe: [[IFRS SDS]] does not have double materiality, but has both impact and financial - just separately instead of together


# Case Studies
- [[L3 Case Study ASSET]]
