- **Countries maximize their combined output by specializing in the production of goods for which they have a comparative advantage.
	- CCBE content

Adam Smith's distinction between "value in use" and "value in exchange" highlights a paradox. Which of the following statement/s is/are correct?
- Smith's labor theory of value is able to resolve the paradox.
- **Diamonds, although less useful than water, have a higher exchange value.
- **The paradox illustrates a weakness in classical price theory by failing to provide an adequate account of demand.

In Adam Smith's example of a primitive society with free access to hunting grounds, what is/are the key determinant(s) of the exchange ratio between a beaver and a deer?

Which of the following statement/s about Ricardo's theories on taxation and loan financing is/are correct?
- **Taxation and loan financing of public expenditure are economically equivalent, meaning that citizens bear the same overall financial burden in either case.
	- e.g. financing a war, tax and loans are the same - just the amount is relevant
	- more "honest" to work with taxation rather than loan financing
- Loan financing is generally preferable to taxation because it avoids imposing immediate costs on taxpayers.
