# Explanatory Modeling
- theory -> hypotheses -> statistical test -> effect size & result
- [[Counterfactual]]

## Conditions
- X: independent 
- Y: dependent
- Y follows X temporally
- Y changes as X changes and the relationship is significant
- No other cause should eliminate the relation between X and Y
	- changes in X produce changes in Y
	- ceteris paribus (holding all else constant)

## Selection Bias
- [[Errors and Biases]]
- groups needs to be random and representative
- one normally cannot randomly assign traits, only memberships to groups
	- e.g. one cannot assign a different nationality, but we can create randomly mixed groups
- how to circumvent:
	- randomly select from population you want to study
	- randomly assign to different groups
