# Definition
Motivation can be defined as the force that initiates, guides and maintains goal-oriented behaviors. 

A person’s motivation to pursue a certain goal is determined by situational stimuli, personal preferences, and the interaction of the two. 
	-> everything is an interaction

The forces that trigger motivation can be biological, emotional, cognitive or social.

# Motivational Factors
## Personal
- needs
	- basic physiological needs, such as hunger and thirst, that are shared by all humans
- implicit motives
	- affectively charged preferences for certain kinds of incentives (habitual propensities) that are acquired in early childhood (McClelland, Koestner, & Weinberger, 1989)
- explicit motives
	- verbally represented (or representable) self-images, values, and goals that people attribute to themselves

## Situational
- every positive or negative outcome that a situation can promise or signal to an individual is called an “incentive” and has “demand characteristics” for an appropriate action. Incentives may be associated with the action itself, its outcome, or various consequences of an action outcome

# Intrinsic vs Extrinsic
## Intrinsic
- within the individual
	- autonomy
	- mastery
	- purpose

### Example
- hobbies
	- mastery of a skill
	- purpose in pursuing a hobby

## Extrinsic
- outside the individual
	- compensation
	- punishment (or fear of)
	- reward

### Example
- work
- university

## Combination
- n = 51 kids, 40 to 63 months old
- measure of intrinsic motivation: how long the children were drawing

- 3 conditions
	- expected reward: told before they receive a reward
	- unexpected reward: not told before but still receive a reward
	- nothing

- intrinsic motivation (unexpected reward and no reward) > external motivation (told to receive a reward)

# Crowding-Out Effect
- When external interventions (e.g., external rewards) undermine intrinsic motivation for an activity that is originally intrinsically motivated

- According to the Cognitive Evaluation Theory (Deci & Ryan, 1985), the following conditions have to be fulfilled:
	- the activity is originally intrinsically motivated &
	- the external intervention diminishes a person’s sense of autonomy and / or sense of competence

- External interventions which are perceived as controlling undermine a person’s sense of autonomy, e.g.: 
	- Expected tangible rewards which are directly contingent on behavior
	- Performance expectations that convey pressure 
	- Strict deadlines

- External interventions which are not perceived as controlling or to a lesser extent, e.g.:
	- Tangible rewards which are not directly contingent on behavior
	- Unexpected tangible rewards 
	- Setting your own deadlines

- External interventions undermining a person’s sense of competence, e.g.: 
	- Negative feedback without any “informational” value
	- Negative performance expectation without any “informational” value
 
- External interventions strengthening a person’s sense of competence, e.g.:
	- Positive feedback 
	- Positive performance expectations
	- “informational” feedback
	- Workshops / training tailored to a person’s needs, helping to improve their skills / advancing their knowledge

## Pay-for-Performance
- e.g. commissions
	- could earn infinite if one could work infinite
- can incentivize the wrong thing
	- e.g. reducing quality of sales for higher current sales count while sacrificing future sales count

# Algorithmic vs Heuristic
#todo 

## Algorithmic Tasks
- mostly extrinsic motivation
- monetary bonus or promotion

## Heuristic Tasks
- mostly intrinsic motivation

### Promoting Intrinsic Motivation
- foster autonomy
- acknowledge competence
- opportunities to improve skills
- create purpose and meaningful rationale
