# Definition
Motivation can be defined as the force that initiates, guides and maintains goal-oriented behaviors. 

A person’s motivation to pursue a certain goal is determined by situational stimuli, personal preferences, and the interaction of the two. 
	-> everything is an interaction

The forces that trigger motivation can be biological, emotional, cognitive or social.

# Motivational Factors
## Personal
- needs
	- basic physiological needs, such as hunger and thirst, that are shared by all humans
- implicit motives
	- affectively charged preferences for certain kinds of incentives (habitual propensities) that are acquired in early childhood (McClelland, Koestner, & Weinberger, 1989)
- explicit motives
	- verbally represented (or representable) self-images, values, and goals that people attribute to themselves

## Situational
- every positive or negative outcome that a situation can promise or signal to an individual is called an “incentive” and has “demand characteristics” for an appropriate action. Incentives may be associated with the action itself, its outcome, or various consequences of an action outcome

# Intrinsic vs Extrinsic
## Intrinsic
- within the individual
	- autonomy
	- mastery
	- purpose

### Example
- hobbies
	- mastery of a skill
	- purpose in pursuing a hobby

## Extrinsic
- outside the individual
	- compensation
	- punishment (or fear of)
	- reward

### Example
- work
- university

## Combination
- n = 51 kids, 40 to 63 months old
- measure of intrinsic motivation: how long the children were drawing

- 3 conditions
	- expected reward: told before they receive a reward
	- unexpected reward: not told before but still receive a reward
	- nothing

- intrinsic motivation (unexpected reward and no reward) > external motivation (told to receive a reward)

# Crowding-Out Effect
- When external interventions (e.g., external rewards) undermine intrinsic motivation for an activity that is originally intrinsically motivated
