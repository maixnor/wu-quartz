# Overestimation
An inflated estimation of one‘s actual ability, performance or chance of success 

If a student who took a 10-item quiz believes that he answered five of the questions correctly when, in fact, he got only three correct, then he overestimated his score. 

# Overplacement
One‘s belief that they are better than others (better-than-average effect)

If a student guessed that her score was the best in the class when, in fact, half of the class scored better than she did, then she has overplaced her score relative to those of others. 

# Overprecision
An excessive certainty regarding the accuracy of one‘s belief

If 100 students were all at least 90% sure that they had scored below 5 on the 10-item quiz but, in fact, 20% of them had scored over 5, then their judgments would display overprecision.
