## Adam Smith
- invisible hand 
- when you benefit yourself, you can benefit society
- markets need structure
- ethics important
- ground rules for government 
- against monopoly
- concern for poverty: criticism against employers who don’t want high wages who don’t look at impact of own profit
- government should provide public goods (things that aren’t profitable)
- markets need guiding principles
- against mercantilism. (Hoarding gold, zero sum game ) he argues that a nations true wealth is based on value they offer people. Wants free trade. No tariffs. Nations should specialize. About efficiency on country level
- what makes a nation wealthy? Division of labor needs a big enough market (more people and more trade)
- theory of value: value in use vs value in exchange. 
- labor theory of value: price is fundamentally determined by how much labor goes into production. But real world markets are different. Eg skills, land, risk, machinery, capital. Natural price reflects that
- market price can fluctuate though. Short term events
- value vs price
- over time market prices converge on value. Self correcting mechanism 
- for that mechanism you need competition and efficient resource use
- businesses need competition. Gov needs to fight monopolies 
- gov needs to intervene where market might fail and for fairness
- he wants to increase pie and slice it fairly
- concerned about poor. Society is responsible on weakest members
- sees role for gov in education, infrastructure and justice
- no gov welfare. Create dependency and less incentive to work
- he wants human flourishing 
- economic growth: population growth. More demand but also larger workforce and larger markets
- greater specialization and profuctivity and innovation. Positive feedback loop
- also essential: capital accumulatuon: saving for future production 
- human capital: skills and knowledge ofworkforce
