- Very low [[GHG Emissions]]  scenario: 
	- 1.5 C by 2100
	- SSP1-1.9: The IPCCâ€™s most optimistic scenario, this describes a world where global CO2 emissions are cut to net zero around 2050.
- Low [[GHG emissions]] scenario: 
	- 1.8C by 2100 
	- SSP1-2.6: In the next-best scenario, global CO2 emissions are cut severely, but not as fast, reaching net-zero after 2050.
- Intermediate [[GHG Emissions]] scenario: 
	- 2.7C by 2100 
	- SSP2-4.5: CO2 emissions hover around current levels before starting to fall mid-century, but do not reach net-zero by 2100.
- High [[GHG emissions]] scenario: 
	- 3.6C by 2100
	- SSP3-7.0: On this path, emissions and temperatures rise steadily and CO2 emissions roughly double from current levels by 2100.
- Very high [[GHG emissions]] scenario: 
	- 4.4C by 2100
	- SSP5-8.5: This is a future to avoid at all costs. Current CO2 emissions levels roughly double by 2050.
