# Definitions
- Emotion - indicates a subjective, affective state ( reaction pattern) that is relatively intense and that occurs in response to something we experience
- Mood - prolonged, less intense, affective state that does not occur in response to something we experience

# Process of Emotions
## Old Theories
- James-Lange theory
	- arousal -> heart pounding -> fear (emotion)
- Canon-Bard theory
	- arousal -> { heart pounding + fear (emotion) }
- Schachter-Singer two factor theory
	- arousal -> { heart pounding + cognitive label (I'm scared) } -> fear (emotion)

## Current Theory
- subjective experience
	- While basic emotions are expressed by all individuals regardless of culture or upbringing, the experience that produces them can be highly subjective
- physiological response
	- This physiological response is the result of the autonomic nervous system’s reaction to the emotion we’re experiencing. The autonomic nervous system controls our involuntary bodily responses and regulates our fight-or-flight response
- behavioral response
	- The behavioral response aspect of the emotional response is the actual expression of the emotion. Behavioral responses can include a smile, a grimace, a laugh or a sigh, along with many other reactions depending on societal norms and personality

## Misattribution of Arousal
- arousal can be generally within situation, not with specific sources
	- it doesn't matter where the arousal comes from, all arousal is equal
- Dutton & Aaron (1974)
	- n = 85
	- setup 
		- arousing chain bridge (swaying, tilting, etc... feeling of falling off)
		- vs. non-arousing solid bridge
		- doing a questionnaire on the bridge with some sexual content
	- result
		- men on the arousing bridge produced more sexual imagery in their stories, called the interviewer more often afterwards (50% vs 12.5% control group)
		- arousal of bridge (fear) transposed to sexual arousal

# Primary vs Secondary
- primary emotion
	- directly triggered by event
	- love, joy, anger, sadness, surprise, fear
- secondary emotion
	- depending on situation and primary emotion
	- passion, optimism, irritation, disgust, shame, nervousness

# Perspectives
- pessimistic view
	- bring about impulsive decisions
	- adversely affect decision-making process by influencing informed beliefs
	- emotions can be in the way of rationality
- optimistic view
	- emotions play a positive role in the decision-making process
	- emotions show information about aspects that cannot be inferred consciously

# Affect Integrated Model of Decision Making
![[affect_integrated_model.png]]
- current emotions influence the situation and the expected outcomes
- what I expect influences my current emotions and my evaluation
	- if I'm sad I won't have a good expectation and therefore a bad evaluation
- characteristics of decision-maker and options
- incidental influences (bodily condition, mood, weather, carryover effects)

## Effects of Fear and Anger
- fear ... generally applicable security measures
- anger ... more optimism, specific security measures

## Expected vs Immediate Affect
| ref               | expected affect                                              | immediate affect                                                                             |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **definition**    | Prediction about how I will feel when a certain event occurs | Affect felt during the decision (due to the expectation or due to other influencing factors) |
| **time**          | future                                                       | today                                                                                        |
| **advantages**    | Best way to ensure long-term well-being                      | Prioritizes information processing and fosters important considerations                      |
| **disadvantages** | Expectations might be wrong                                  | Might lead to a decision which goes against our own interests                                |

## Financial Cost of Sadness
- Lerner & Weber (2013)
	- n = 202
	- setup
		- first watch a clip (neutral, disgusting, sad)
		- then decide between receive money now and receive more money in 1-6 weeks
	- result
		- sadness reduces patience
		- 13% to 43% less money to skip period of 3 months until payment

# Emotions and interaction between people
## Emotions at Work
- influence belief about value of job, company or team
- affects behavior at work
	- events cause different emotions in different people
	- symmetrical emotions -> self-reinforcing in both positive/negative aspects
		- positive emotions produce more positive emotion-inducing behavior
		- negative emotions produce more negative emotion-inducing behavior
- **pride:**
	- self-focused positive emotion
	- appraisal of self-success, status and competence
- **interest:**
	- being engaged, caught up, fascinated, curious
	- creates sustained motivation
- **guilt:**
	- moral emotion, violating social norms
	- triggers reparatory behavior - apologizing, changing own behavior
- **boredom:**
	- “the aversive experience of having an unfulfilled desire to be engaged in a satisfying activity”

## Emotions & Decision-Making
- Integral emotions influence decision making
	- Integral emotion as beneficial guide
	- Integral emotion as bias. 
	- Moderating factors. 
- Incidental emotions influence decision making
	- Incidental emotion as bias. Spillovers (Han et al, 2007, Keltner & Lerner 2010)
	- Negative (vs. positive) newspaper stories -> pessimistic estimates of fatalities (e.g. frequency of hart disease, Johnson & Tversky, 1983)
- Beyond valence: Specific emotions influence decision making
	- Emotions of the same valence, such as anger and sadness, are associated with different antecedent appraisals (Smith & Ellsworth 1985)
	- Predictive power of models including specific emotions exceeds valance based models.
