# Data
- surveys
	- careful with personal identification
	- form brackets rather than actual values -> less identifiable
	- e.g. 
- company data
	- data which the company has anyway
	- e.g. amount of sick days
- empirical data
	- e.g. heart rate, skin conductivity
	
## What to measure
- control group vs treatment group

## When to measure
- before vs after experiment

# Objectives
- measurement of changes
	- across time and situation
	- e.g. attitudes
- [[Operationalization]]
	- operational definition may vary
	- take definition into account
- conclusions should rely on many studies
	- not just one, not just your own

# Participants
- anything with a social flavor in the experiment will be different in a different region
- practical problem: there is little variance with the participants
- always take into account if the participants of a study are relevant for your context

# Results
- again [[Correlation vs Causation]]
- [[Inference]] Problems
	- time plots are not enough
		- a [[Counter Factual]] is needed
	- also multiple samples are not better than single samples
		- more robust, just not solving the missing [[counter factual]] 
		
# Potential Solutions for Missing Counter Factuals
- [[Counter Factual]] #todo find examples for each
- Propensity Score Matching (PSM)
- Instrumental Variables (IV)
- Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD)
	- difference between birthday at 31st August and 1st September is just 1 day
	- but one gets in the school system directly, the other waits for another year
- Difference in Difference (DiD)

# Experiment Types
- [[Qualitative Research]]
	- becomes more quantitative since the invention of LLMs
- [[Correlation Studies]]
	- [[Survey Design]]
