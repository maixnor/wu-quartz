- $\mathbb E[r_{i}] = r_{f} + \beta^{\text{eff}}_{i}(\mathbb E[r_{\text{eff}}]-r_{f})$
- tangent portfolio ... 
	- best portfolio for any and all investors
		- investors hold scaled tangent portfolio
	- best risk/return tradeoff for all portfolios
	- highest [[sharpe ratio]] of any asset
	- shorting the risk-free assets can improve the return even past the efficient frontier
		- scaling the portfolio by risk-factor
			- higher risk-factor = higher returns
- [[CAPM]] #slides 96 #todo
	- base on very strong assumptions
	- conclusions are not completely accurate
	- [[cost of capital]] is not included in the model
