# Term based interest rates
- expressed in annual/yearly time horizon (p.a./per annum)
- interest is just a promise 
	- debtor can default -> unable to pay back interest
- different interest rates based on when a loan is taken on
- sovereign/country bond -> risk free
	- risk of e.g. Germany defaulting is basically 0
