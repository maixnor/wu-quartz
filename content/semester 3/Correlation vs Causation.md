# Reasons for Correlation
- Causality 		        x -> y
- Reverse causality	        y -> x
- Simultaneity		        x -> y and y -> x
- Omitted variable bias	z -> x and z -> y, but x !-> y

	- higher swimming rate -> higher shark attack rate
- ice cream consumption **is correlated** to shark attacks
- BUUUUUT ice cream consumption does not **cause** shark attacks
	- when eating ice cream in Vienna there is no shark attack chance
