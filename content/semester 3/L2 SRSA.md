# Challenges when Auditing Sustainability Information
#slides 2

- auditing is always about assessing risk
	- find risks - #todo which risks
	- set up plan to mitigate those risks

- specialized knowledge
	- [[Econometrics]]
	- [[Social Sciences]]

- objectivity
	- dependability of the data disclosed
	- management bias (as always in reporting)
	- [[big bath accounting]]

- [[Audit Trail]] #slides 3
	- even alterations must be traceable
	- comes from accounting software
	- Excel sheets don't have traceability

- [[Materiality Assesment]]
	- not stable over time - can change quickly over time by change in stakeholder preferences
	- fast-paced changes
		- investments cannot be adapted to quickly - hard tradeoffs

- technological - cybersecurity
	- sustainability data is valuable to competitors - lot's of information on production capabilities and actual production amounts
- technological - documentation
	- most costs are internal - auditing company is the cheap part
	- a lot of change which needs to be documented well

- third party data
	- reasonable assurance - supplier needs to be audited to be trustworthy
		- not trustworthy until proven otherwise
	- trust issue - untrustworthy data may through off complete report

- controversies and reputational risks
	- legal implications
		- auditors need to self-assess whether they have the competences to do a sustainability report assessment
		- is it even enough for limited assurance?
		- learning by doing currently

- Fabius Lenhart
- [[KPMG]] - their software solution is "outsourced" to a new company
	- because of independence - independence conflict
- [[RegTech]] - Regulatory Tech
- Customers are banks - evaluating their portfolio based on [[European Green Deal]]
- thresholds for what is green and what is not is dropping every 5 years
	- what is green today might not be in a few years anymore
- where do you get data for:
	- hail chance
	- flooding possibility
	- temperature ranges
- necessary inputs
	- address
	- energy certificate
- [[copernicus]] - space and satallite data
	- recommendation from EU
- assumptions shape the results
	- only top 1% of precipitation or top 0.1% is relevant for you
	- one has to explain that to auditors afterwards
- currently no personal [[incentive]] for a green deal
	- if there was a discount on interest rate on green loans banks could refinance cheaper and therefore prefer a green loan over a non-green loan
	- good auditor needed then - cheating must be impossible
