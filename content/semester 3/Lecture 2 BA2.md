# Measuring Financial Market Performance
- average annual returns big factor
	- S&P 500 (some risk): 6.66%
	- savings account (no risk): 4.70%
- variation (risk) is also big factor
- risk/return relationship is deciding factor
	- performance evaluation should consider both

## Estimate Future performance
- most assets future performance is not known
	- bank will tell you, S&P 500 will not
- assumption: future returns will be similar to the past
	- we can analyse historical data and extrapolate into the future

### Historical Returns
- non-dividend paying stock: [[Lecture 1 BA2#Prices to Returns|simple return]]
- with paying dividends:
	- simple return: $r_{t}= \frac{p_t-p_{t-1}}{p_{t-1}} = \frac{p_t}{p_{t-1}} - 1$ #todo add dividend
- simple vs log-return
	- the larger the difference in price the larger the log/simple return difference is
	- depends on application, more convenient in certain situations
		- e.g. aggregation

### Aggregate Returns
- simple returns: [[compounding]]
- log returns can be simply added up
#### Example


### Cross-Section Portfolio
- simple returns: weighted sum
- log returns: impossible
	- convert to simple returns for weights, log the weights, then multiply everything #todo check that
