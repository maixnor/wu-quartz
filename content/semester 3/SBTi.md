> Science Based Target initiative

# General
- best practices
- technical assistance
- independent assessment and validation of targets
- reduce total [[GHG Emissions]] to 0 or residual level

# Net Zero
- near-term (5-10 years)
- long-term (25 years)
- does not give the opportunity to offset any emissions
	- goal is really to reach net-zero - not climate neutral
- residual emissions
	- anything after long term goal needs to be offset by [[Emission Offsetting]]
		- e.g. carbon capture
	- permanently remove CO2eq from atmosphere
- beyond value chain
	- investments outside of value chain to remove [[GHG Emissions]]
	- reporting should be annual
- ambition levels by sector

# Signing Up
- select a base year
	- [[GHG Emissions]] accurate and verifiable
	- needs to be representative
	- not earlier than 2015
- calculate emissions
	- full [[GHG Emissions]] inventory
	- [[GHG Protocol Standard]]
- set target boundaries
	- near term at least 95% reduction in scope 1 and 2
	- long term at least 90% reduction in scope 3 + near term goals
	- residual with [[Emission Offsetting]]
- choose a target year
	- near term - max 10y from submission date
	- long term - max 2050
- calculate targets
	- mitigation pathway and specific company inputs
	- outputs of calculation ... minimum requirements

# Previous Notes
- company can submit their climate stats and their planned improvements
- they evaluate if their improvements and plans meet the [[Paris 1.5]] agreement
- they don't help with the realization, just the setting of the goals
	- SBTi can also provide people to help with setting these goals
