- [[Mnemonics]]

# Smart Learning Environments
- don't send out material before, nobody will read it -> [[Amazon Reading Time]]
- [[Roleplay]] is a strong tool to build behavior
- [[implementation intention]] -> think about when and where instead of if you will do something

- best final response after workshop
	- 2 days after the end of the workshop 
		- forgetting kicks in, can be refreshed to stick for longer
	- content should be a condensed to refresh/relearn quickly
- not best final response
	- sending email right after the end of the workshop or in the evening
	- nobody will read (spent from the day)
	- no forgetting has happened yet
