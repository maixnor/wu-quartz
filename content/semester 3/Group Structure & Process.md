# Group
- two or more people
- who interact
- who are independent

### Need to Belong
- evolutionary explanation: being in a group is survival advantage
- together hunting, mating, finding partner, etc is easier

### Advantages
- goal attainment: goals can be reached quicker and more efficiently
	- e.g. help against procrastination
- epistemic: others as source of information (reduce uncertainties)
- behavioral safety: norms, social roles, rules
- social identify: sense of belonging and social identity

### Belonging and Distinction
- provide us with a social identity
- groups give us a sense of belonging but also make us feel distinctive
	- [[Errors and Biases#In-Group Bias|In-Group Bias]]
		- tendency to favor members, characteristics, etc of own group in comparison to other groups
- support of self-esteem
	- feeling proud when my football team wins
		- I still can't play any better and did not achieve anything, but I feel good anyways
	- not included in [[Maslov Hierachy]] -> massive criticism

# How to form Groups
## Group Discussion I
- how to form a group quickly
	- people have different departments, jobs, pay, etc
### Forming a Group
- form hierarchies (still a work-group) and self-assign tasks
- form their own deadlines -> autonomy
- ice-breaker questions
	- talk about values (discipline, work ethic, commitment)
	- personal interest to be innovative
	- what do you need/want in a team?
	- how do you imagine the best team structure for you?
	- when do you have the best idea? what do you need for it?
	- how would you imagine the place where you are innovative?
- how for people are opening up should be up to the individual, not forced upon by the boss or team members
	- mixing work and home too much can break either relationship, maybe even both
- some hierarchy yes, but not too rigid and deep structure
- distribute responsibility and make them care

# Stages of Group Development
- Forming
	- exchange of information, task exploration
- Storming
	- disagreement over goals and procedures
- Norming
	- formation of consensus and norms
- Performing
	- goal-focused efforts, orientation toward mastery & performance
- Adjourning
	- completion of tasks, dissolution of roles
	- "letting go" of tasks, taking 15 minutes to discuss how it went and what we can learn from the experience
	- moment of truth, no dependence on teammates anymore

## Social Norms
- reflect groups generally accepted way of thinking feeling or acting
	- descriptive norms = what people think, feel, do
	- injunctive norms = what people should think, feel, do
	- can be different: e.g. littering: nobody should, but some do anyways
- rules needed so groups can function
- can form naturally
- do not have to be formal (written down)
- pressure to follow
	- [[group conformity]] -> "yielding to group pressures"

## Social Roles
- social, cultural, ecomnoic, political and historical factors
- social roles are assigned to groups
- group members perform role-appropriate behaviors
- role-associated behaviors are attributed to personality characteristics
- stereotypes of group froms

## Conformity Bias
- Hoffman & Hurst
- n=48
	- orinthians and ackmians
	- employed within household (child care) or outside
	- biases already formed
	- stereotypes were assigned to whole groups, even to individuals which are in the group but do not share the same characteristics


# Social Facilitation
## Cockroaches
- Zajonc 1969
- n = 72
	- solving a simple and complex maze either with or without an audience
	- other cockroaches placed in glass containers around the maze
	- in a simple maze the audience improves the performance, in the complex maze not

## Social Facilitation & Social Loafing
- presence of others
	- individual efforts can be evaluated (Facilitation)
	- alertness, evaluation apprehension
	- arousal
		- enhanced performance on simple task
		- impaired performance on complex task
- presence of others
	- individual efforts **cannot** be evaluated (Loafing)
	- no evaluation apprehension
		- I am not in the focus, but the group
	- relaxation
		- impaired performance on simple task
		- enhanced performance on complex task

### Empirical Study 
- Jackson & Williams 1985
- n = 48
	- #todo p1 6 27
	- similar to cockroaches, simple and complex maze
	- better performance for complex task when "payed" together
		- not for simple tasks
