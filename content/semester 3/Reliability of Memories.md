- #todo psych 64
- offer et al (2002)
	- n = 73
	- memory accurace not better than expected by chance

- reconstructing fills in the gaps
	- reconstructing happens in the same part of the brain where we imagine things
- contradicting values/incentives than the current ones
	- shame of the past selves - maybe also subconsciously
	- almost a coping mechanism/trauma coping

- memory $\neq$ video recorder
	- memory = constructive process 
- correspondence
	- memory should reflect the true experience
- coherence
	- we like consistence and being predictable
	- a stupid rebellion can change motivation afterwards
	- a period when we were not acting out our desired values are conveniently forgotten
	- over time coherence wins
- memories about 10th birthday, amazing vacation 2 years ago, first love, summer job are not as accurate as people believe them to be
	- not just about oneself - also about everyone/everything else
