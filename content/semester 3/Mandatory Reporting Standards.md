# Examples
- [[QuickShip Logistics AG]]
# Carbon vs Climate Neutral vs Net Zero
- mentioning [[GHG Emissions]]
- carbon neutral ... offset just CO2 emissions
- climate neutral ... offset all emissions
- net zero ... reduce/remove all unnecessary emissions first then offset remaining

# Comparing Sustainability
- financial reporting is mainly there to compare companies
	- which company will give me the highest return?
- in sustainability that is not quite the same
	- comparability only if same markers are collected for all companies
	- only really works between 
- comparability will be even more difficult when different countries have different mandatory reporting standards
	- [[Interoperability]]
	- [[IFRS SDS]] and [[ESRS]] are mainly aligned
		- e.g. [[IFRS SDS]] has financed emissions / [[ESRS]] has non-shareholder impacts
- digital tagging with [[ESEF]]
	- digital reporting standard
	- comparing 50 companies means importing 50 digital reports
	- then a simple comparison with alike-tagged data

# Levels of Regulation
- supranational
	- e.g. [[ESRS]] in whole of [[EU]]
- country level
	- e.g. [[IFRS SDS]] in just [[Turkey]]
- exchange level
	- e.g. just a single [[stock exchange]]
