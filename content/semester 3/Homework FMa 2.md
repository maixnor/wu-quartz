## Task 1: Who is part of the "labor force" and which people are "out of the labor force"?

The "labor force" constitutes two parts of the population:

- **Unemployed**: Those who are actively seeking employment.
- **Employed**: Those who have jobs.

The "out of labor force" consists of those people who are of working age (15-64) but are not actively seeking employment for various reasons (e.g., students, pensioners, homemakers, etc.).

## Task 2: How are the employment rate and the unemployment rate defined?

The employment rate is defined as the percentage of the labor force who have a job. 

Similarly, the unemployment rate is defined as a percentage of the labor force who do not have jobs but are actively seeking work.

## Task 3: Explain the concept of the reservation wage.

The reservation wage is the minimum wage level at which a worker is willing to accept a job, influenced by alternative opportunities such as unemployment benefits. It varies among individuals based on factors such as how much one can buy with unemployment benefits or how much one values free time, experience, and personal financial situations. Essentially, it represents the lowest acceptable compensation for their labor. The reservation wage also accounts for the opportunity cost of remaining unemployed, playing a crucial role in labor supply dynamics, as it determines whether potential workers will consider a job or remain unemployed based on the offered wages relative to their expectations and alternatives.

## Task 4: Explain the concept of efficiency wages. Why would employers pay higher wages?

Efficiency wages are wages that employers choose to pay above the market equilibrium level, motivated by several factors that benefit the organization. By offering higher wages, employers can increase worker productivity, reduce turnover rates, attract higher-quality candidates, and foster loyalty among employees. When workers perceive their pay as competitive and fair, they are more likely to be motivated, committed, and invested in their work, ultimately leading to significant cost savings in recruitment and training while enhancing overall business efficiency.

## Task 5: On which factors does the bargaining power of the workers depend?

The bargaining power of workers depends on the following factors:

1. **The nature of the job and cost to replace the worker**: Individual workers with unique or rare skills, better education, or longer/varied work experience have a higher bargaining power than less educated persons or those with more general skills.

2. **Labor market conditions**: The bargaining power of workers correlates positively with the probability that a worker can find an alternative job. It typically increases during periods of economic growth and lower unemployment rates, and decreases during crises. It is also generally lower in less competitive industries characterized by monopsonic employers.

3. **Labor rights determined by the legal and institutional framework**: Employee protection such as minimum wage, strong labor unions, and higher unemployment benefits increases the collective bargaining power of workers.

## Task 6: What is the value of the price premium $m$ in a market with perfect competition?

The price premium $m$ is defined as the markup of the price over the marginal cost that businesses can charge due to possessing some market power as a result of imperfect competition. In a market with perfect competition, firms do not have market power due to the large number of buyers and sellers with complete knowledge of the market, and free exit and entry of firms selling a homogeneous good. This results in firms being 'price takers', meaning they must accept the equilibrium price where $P = MC$ at which goods are sold in the market. If a perfectly competitive firm attempts to charge even a tiny amount more than the market price, it will be unable to make any sales, indicating the value of $m$ is zero.

## Task 7: What is the relationship between the natural rate of unemployment and the natural level of production?

The natural rate of unemployment is the unemployment rate at which the actual price level is equal to the expected price level. For a given labor force, the natural unemployment rate determines the level of employment, and given the production function, the level of employment determines the level of output. 

Expressed mathematically, when the unemployment rate is equal to the natural rate $u_n$, employment is given by 

$$L = L_n$$ 

(where $L_n$ is the natural level of employment), and output is equal to 

$$Y_n = L_n \cdot Y_p$$ 

(where $Y_p$ is the labor productivity). Consequently, a lower natural rate of unemployment is associated with a higher natural level of production $Y_n$, and vice versa. This relationship makes sense logically; a lower natural unemployment rate implies that more workers are employed in productive activities, boosting economic output.

## Task 8: Present the wage-setting curve verbally and graphically.

The wage-setting equation is given by:

$$\frac{W}{P} = F(u, z)$$

where:
- $W$ is the nominal wage,
- $P$ is the price level,
- $u$ is the unemployment rate, and
- $z$ represents other factors that may affect wage setting (such as unemployment benefits).

The equilibrium unemployment rate, $u_n$, is where the real wage chosen in wage setting is equal to the real wage implied by price setting. This is called the natural rate of unemployment. 

### Downward Sloping Curve

The wage-setting curve is typically downward sloping because a higher unemployment rate corresponds to lower wages. As unemployment increases, workers have less bargaining power, which leads to a decrease in wages that employers are willing to pay.

### Shifting the Curve

The expected price level affects wage-setting because higher expected prices lead to higher wage demands from employees. Factors that can shift the wage-setting curve include changes in minimum wage laws, the strength of labor unions, and variations in unemployment benefits.

## Task 9: Assume that unemployment benefits decrease. Analyze this change verbally and graphically.

A decrease in unemployment benefits, represented by a decrease in $z$, affects the labor market as follows:

- **Downward Shift of the Wage-Setting Curve**: Lower unemployment benefits reduce workers' bargaining power, leading to a decrease in the real wage for any given unemployment rate. This shifts the wage-setting curve (WS) downwards.
- **Movement Along the Price-Setting Curve**: The price-setting curve (PS) remains unchanged as it is determined by firms' markup decisions.
- **New Equilibrium with Lower Unemployment**: The new equilibrium point occurs at a lower real wage and a lower unemployment rate. The reduced bargaining power of workers leads them to accept lower real wages, allowing firms to hire more workers.

## Task 10: Derive the original Phillips curve from the wage and price setting equations. How is expected inflation formed?

The Phillips Curve relationship involves:

$$\pi = \pi^e + (m + z) - \alpha u$$

where:
- $\pi$ is actual inflation,
- $\pi^e$ is expected inflation,
- $m$ is markup,
- $z$ represents other factors affecting wage determination, and
- $u$ is unemployment.

### Expected Inflation Formation

Expected inflation, $\pi^e$, is formed based on past inflation experiences. If people form their expectations around past inflation rates, it leads to:

$$\pi^e_t = (1 - \theta) \pi + \theta \pi_{t-1}$$

This function establishes the relationship between current inflation expectations and past inflation outcomes.

## Task 11: What relationship does the modified Phillips curve represent?

The modified Phillips curve shows the relationship between inflation, expected inflation, and unemployment. It represents the negative relationship between the unemployment rate and the change in the inflation rate, indicating that lower unemployment rates generally correspond to higher inflation rates.

The modified Phillips Curve is expressed as:

$$\pi_t = \pi^e + (m - z) - \alpha u_t$$

where:
- $\pi_t$ is the current inflation rate,
- $\pi^e$ is the expected inflation rate,
- $m$ is the markup,
- $z$ is other factors affecting wages, and
- $\alpha$ is the sensitivity of inflation with respect to unemployment.

### Expected Inflation Formation

Expected inflation can also be influenced by how people form their inflation expectations, either by anchoring them to a stable target or by relying on past inflation rates.
