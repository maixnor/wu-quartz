# Modern Portfolio Theory
## History
- [[Harry Markowitz]] #todo research a bit
- balance risk and return
	- just highest expected return is not reasonable
	- utility is more important
- optimal portfolio = minimal risk for a given return
	- or maximum return for a given risk
- ground work for modern theory
- expected return = average of historical returns
	- no sensible prediction possible
- [[volatility]] #slides 76
- [[diversification]] #slides 76
	- uncorrelated stocks are not affected by same risks

##  Optimal Portfolio
- #slides 77/78

### Simplified Model
- #slides 79
- [[Risk Aversion]]
- $r_{P} = w_{A}r_{A} + w_{B}r_{B}$
- $w$ ... weights ($w_{A}+w_{B} = 1$)
