	- theories: explanations based on observations
	- empiric: systematic data collection and evaluation

- experiments only on subsample, result projected on population
- truth is never known for certain -> [[Popper Logic#Errors|Errors happen]]
	- always look for errors when analyzing data or conclusions
- research is a process!
	- not a result
- research objectives 
	- from abstract concept to clearly defined and measurable stat/stats
	- check the method too, not just the abstract
