- differential psychology
	- differences between people
- social psychology
	- personal perception with their values
- general psychology
	- identification of general laws
	- explanation of the basic mechanisms of cognitive performance
	- knowledge about process of information processing
	- basis for other branches of psychology

- asymmetric information based on different biases and information retention
	- give 2 people the same information and they have 2 different understandings/perception

- theory vs empiricism
	- theories: explanations based on observations
	- empiric: systematic data collection and evaluation

- experiments only on subsample, result projected on population
	- not always applicable
- truth is never known for certain -> [[Popper Logic#Errors|Errors happen]]
	- always look for errors when analyzing data or conclusions
	- even in your own works
- research is a process!
	- not a result/event
- research objectives 
	- from abstract concept to clearly defined and measurable stat/stats
	- check the method too, not just the abstract

- laboratory experiments
	- most highly controlled method of hypothesis testing
	- goal: Isolation of a [[Correlation vs Causation|cause-and-effect]] relationship
	- independent variables (IVs) are predicted to impact the dependent variables (DVs)
	- manipulation of IVs, then measurement of DVs while controlling all other confounding variables
	- random assignment of participants to different conditions (= different versions of IVs)
