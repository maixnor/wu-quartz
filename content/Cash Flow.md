The continuous movement of cash into and out of a business during a business year.

> Cash is the most liquid asset of a business (money bills, bank deposits)

- all the Cash Flows summed up are the change in position of "Cash" in the [[Balance Sheet]]

different positions
- operations (normal business activities, production, sales)
	- hopefully positive
- investments (new buildings, factories, etc)
	- usually negative
	- only positive if de-investing, e.g. selling a factory
- financing (loans, external financing resources)
	- usually positive
	- only negative if no new external capital is entering the business, e.g. only repaying loans

continuous (more than 1 year) negative cash flow is a telltale sign of a struggling business.
### Causes of Cash Flow Problems
- overtrading
	- too fast growth or investments
- investing too much in fixed assets
- stockpiling
	- money tied up in stock is not productive
- allowing too much credit 
	- to your own customers 
- taking too much credit and overborrowing 
	- loans, external investments, paying dividends, etc
- unexpected changes in demand and in costs
### Improving Cash Flow
- overdraft facilities (credit cards)
	- usually highest cost per capital
- combination of short- and long-term loans
- reduce stocks (inventory)
- use a factoring company
- sell unused assets
- sell and leaseback
- stimulate sales for cash (e.g. discounts)
- delay own payments

# Operating Cash Flow (Indirect Method)

- start from operating profit from [[Profit and Loss Statement]] 
- minus [[Non-Cash Transactions#Income|non-cash income]] 
	- amortization, depreciation, etc
- plus [[Non-Cash Transactions|non-cash expenses]]
	- changes in inventory, etc
- = cash flow from operations

or another variant of writing it down

- start with EBT
	- - write-up
	- + deprecation, amortization, impairment -> [[Non-Cash Transactions]]
- +/- inventory receivables, [[Sixth Lecture FRA#Deferred Assets and Deferred Liabilities|deferred assets]]
- -/+ payables (except for inventory), provisions, deferred liabilities (not loans, bonds)
- = operations cash flow

### Included/Excluded?
- EBT (operating profit) already includes interest earnings and dividend earnings

# Startup Cash Flow scheme
- future investments need to be subtracted from company values
	- therefore profit is not worth anything
- goal: invest more and more until operations carry the investments themselves or investments can be lowered without reducing operation profit
