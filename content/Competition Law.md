# Why Compete?
## Competition Definition
> "a striving for the custom and business of people in the market place"
> &amp; Whish/Bailey

- Factors:
	- price
	- quality
	- innovation -> patents, design
	- reputation -> trademarks
	- privacy
	- sustainability

- Competition can also happen on the input side
	- educated staff
	- special ingredients / raw materials
	- patents
## Competition Types
- **Perfect Competition** -> a lot of suppliers, no [[Market Entry Barriers]]
- **Oligopoly** -> a few suppliers, almost no competition
- **Monopoly** -> no competition, just one supplier
# Goals of Competition Law
- again, no global competition law
- supranational competition law (EU)
	- protect competitive process
	- promote consumer welfare
	- market integration -> integrate Economies of member states to stop future wars from happening
## Level of Enforcement
- economization of [[Antitrust]] -> which economists to believe?
- [[Laissez Faire]] vs [[Strict Regime]]
- what would you rather? 
	- False positives (type 1 error) or false negatives (type 2 error)?
## Public Enforcement
- official authorities
- European Commission **and** national competition authorities (NCAs)
	- cases with relevance for the internal market
- Austria: BWB - Bundes Wettbewerbs Behoerde
- limited resources -> can do only so much
## Private Enforcement
- private persons/companies 
- damage claims
- quasi-endless resources -> enough

- EU -> 90% public, 10% private
- US -> 10% public, 90% private
	- damages are remedied 3-fold in US when breaking competition law
	- 10$ damages are remedied by 30$ from infringing party
# Legal Framework
- [[Kodex Competition Law 2024]]
	- [[Art 101 TFEU]] -> anti-competitive agreements
		- e.g. price agreements between competitors
		- e.g. tying -> bundling products together with malicious intent
	- [[Art 102 TFEU]] -> abuse of market power
	- EU Merger Control ([[EU Merger Regulation]]) 139/2004
