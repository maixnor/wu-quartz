mostly EU law, but also national Austrian law

# Why Compete?
## Competition Definition
> "a striving for the custom and business of people in the market place"
> &amp; Whish/Bailey

- Factors:
	- price
	- quality
	- innovation -> patents, design
	- reputation -> trademarks
	- privacy
	- sustainability

- Competition can also happen on the input side
	- educated staff
	- special ingredients / raw materials
	- patents

## Competition Types
- **Perfect Competition** -> a lot of suppliers, no market entry barriers -> [[Strategic Perspective#Market Barriers]]
- **Oligopoly** -> a few suppliers, almost no competition
- **Monopoly** -> no competition, just one supplier

# Goals of Competition Law
- again, no global competition law
- supranational competition law (EU)
	- protect competitive process
	- promote consumer welfare
	- market integration -> integrate Economies of member states to stop future wars from happening

## Level of Enforcement
- economization of [[Antitrust]] -> which economists to believe?
- [[Laissez Faire]] vs [[Strict Regime]]
- what would you rather? 
	- False positives (type 1 error) or false negatives (type 2 error)?

## Public Enforcement
- official authorities
- European Commission **and** national competition authorities (NCAs)
	- cases with relevance for the internal market
- Austria: BWB - Bundes Wettbewerbs Behoerde
- limited resources -> can do only so much
## Private Enforcement
- private persons/companies 
- damage claims
- quasi-endless resources -> enough

- EU -> 90% public, 10% private
- US -> 10% public, 90% private
	- damages are remedied 3-fold in US when breaking competition law
	- 10$ damages are remedied by 30$ from infringing party

# Legal Framework
- [[Kodex Competition Law 2024]]
	- Art 101 TFEU -> anti-competitive agreements
		- e.g. price agreements between competitors
		- e.g. tying -> bundling products together with malicious intent
	- Art 102 TFEU -> abuse of market power
	- EU Merger Control (EUMR) 139/2004

# Market Definition
- Product Market (paras 25 ff Notice)
	- interchangeability
		- price, quality, functionality -> possible substitute products (para 26 Notice)
	- 3 competitive constrains (para 23 Notice)
		- demand substitutability
		- supply substitutability
		- potential competition
	- [[SSNIP test]]
	- e.g. all soft drinks are in one Product Market
- Geographic Market (paras 38 ff Notice)
	- different countries/regions may have different markets
	- global to local geographic markets
- Temporal Market (paras 13 ff Notice)
	- seasonal work
		- fresh fruits
		- christmas decorations
	- train/flight tickets during peak times (e.g. christmas time)

## Challenges
- innovation
- products in digital platforms
- price might not be monetary
- ecosystems

## Undertaking, not Company
- undertaking -> meant is a "company"
	- local definitions for "company" -> Bulgaria vs Austria have different definitions
- undertaking ... an entity which carries out economic activity

# Article 101 TFEU - Anti-Competitive agreements
- 2 or more undertakings
- agreement, decision or concerted practice
	- written or oral agreement -> although not necessarily a contract
	- gentlemen's agreement included
	- general practice included
	- decision by a [[Trade Association]]
		- Association does not have money, going after member companies therefore
	- concerted practices 
		- parallel behavior hard to distinguish from cooperation
		- burden of proof lies with enforcers (authorities)
		- 3 criteria
			- concerting with each other
			- subsequent conduct on the market
			- cause & effect
		- example: gas station prices
	- horizontal vs vertical agreement
		- horizontal ... refinery cooperating with other refineries
		- vertical ... refinery cooperating with gas stations
			- if in a conglomerate it is okay from anti-competitive
			- but dominant position laws within 102 come into effect 
- appreciable effect on trade between member states
	- EU Laws should only be applied to EU relevant cases 
		- no strictly domestic cases
	- para 52: thresholds ([[NAAT Rule]])
		- market share not above 5%
		- aggregate (horizontal) or suppliers (vertical) annual turnover not above 40 Million EUR
	- para 53: rebuttable positive presumption
		- imports/exports or covers several member states
		- + turnover threshold exceeded
	- **also applies to hardcore restraints**
- appreciable effect on competition
	- effect must be "noticeable" to be illegal
- object or effect of preventing, restricting or distorting competition
	- "restriction of competition"
