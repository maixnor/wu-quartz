mostly EU law, but also national Austrian law

# Why Compete?
## Competition Definition
> "a striving for the custom and business of people in the market place"
> &amp; Whish/Bailey

- Factors:
	- price
	- quality
	- innovation -> patents, design
	- reputation -> trademarks
	- privacy
	- sustainability

- Competition can also happen on the input side
	- educated staff
	- special ingredients / raw materials
	- patents

## Competition Types
- **Perfect Competition** -> a lot of suppliers, no market entry barriers -> [[Strategic Perspective#Market Barriers]]
- **Oligopoly** -> a few suppliers, almost no competition
- **Monopoly** -> no competition, just one supplier

# Goals of Competition Law
- again, no global competition law
- supranational competition law (EU)
	- protect competitive process
	- promote consumer welfare
	- market integration -> integrate Economies of member states to stop future wars from happening

## Level of Enforcement
- economization of [[Antitrust]] -> which economists to believe?
- [[Laissez Faire]] vs [[Strict Regime]]
- what would you rather? 
	- False positives (type 1 error) or false negatives (type 2 error)?

## Public Enforcement
- official authorities
- European Commission **and** national competition authorities (NCAs)
	- cases with relevance for the internal market
- Austria: BWB - Bundes Wettbewerbs Behoerde
- limited resources -> can do only so much
## Private Enforcement
- private persons/companies 
- damage claims
- quasi-endless resources -> enough

- EU -> 90% public, 10% private
- US -> 10% public, 90% private
	- damages are remedied 3-fold in US when breaking competition law
	- 10$ damages are remedied by 30$ from infringing party

# Legal Framework
- [[Kodex Competition Law 2024]]
	- Art 101 TFEU -> anti-competitive agreements
		- e.g. price agreements between competitors
		- e.g. tying -> bundling products together with malicious intent
	- Art 102 TFEU -> abuse of market power
	- EU Merger Control (EUMR) 139/2004

# Market Definition
- Product Market (paras 25 ff Notice)
	- interchangeability
		- price, quality, functionality -> possible substitute products (para 26 Notice)
	- 3 competitive constrains (para 23 Notice)
		- demand substitutability
		- supply substitutability
		- potential competition
	- [[SSNIP test]]
	- e.g. all soft drinks are in one Product Market
- Geographic Market (paras 38 ff Notice)
	- different countries/regions may have different markets
	- global to local geographic markets
- Temporal Market (paras 13 ff Notice)
	- seasonal work
		- fresh fruits
		- christmas decorations
	- train/flight tickets during peak times (e.g. christmas time)
