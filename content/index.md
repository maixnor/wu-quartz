The root node is [[BBE]]. From there on branch out to the different lectures and its topics. Or you can use the powerful search to find notes or the content of notes directly.
# üîì License GPL
Any content published here is publicly available without any costs (free as in free beer). Feel free to clone and redistribute content as you please (free as in freedom) as long as you keep the GPL license. Any additions or alterations need to be contributed (copyleft agreement).

Should you try to run another platform (paid or free, open or proprietary) using my information you either have to quote everything or contribute back any and all alterations.
# ‚úíÔ∏è Contributions
Any and all contributions are welcome. Just text me on whatsapp or contribute directly with the below description. It does not matter if you want to contribute with your own notes or insights or I made a mistake. These notes live off of "peer review" through people like you. Also let me know if an external link is invalid.

To contribute navigate to the [Github](https://github.com/maixnor/wu-quartz/tree/main/content) and search for the file (top of page you are viewing) you want to edit. Then select this file and in the top right you will find the option to edit the file. Or if you want to create a new file select Add File in the top right immediately. Don't forget the file name :).

Once you are done editing hit commit changes and select `Create a¬†**new branch**¬†for this commit and start a pull request`. Then I will take a look at it and approve the PR. Then your contributions are live.
