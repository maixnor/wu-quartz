# Hi
These are my personal notes, made freely available to you.

Any and all contributions are welcome. It does not matter if you want to contribute with your own notes or insights or I made a mistake. These notes live off of "peer review" through people like you. Also let me know if an external link is invalid.

# How to get around town
The root node is [[BBE]]. From there you can access all different courses I have done so far. But there is much more here than just scripts. Most concepts and insights are extracted into separate notes, for example [[Raising Capital]] emphasizes how to raise capital. Then there are also kowns unknowns in the from of grayed links like [[Liquidity]]. This is useful because it highlights where the notes lack knowledge. But one can also see where connections with other notes are. Taking a look at the (local) graph view of [[Liquidity]] really shows the power of the graph view.

# Disclaimer
As these are personal notes everything might be wrong or outdated/irrelevant for any exam. I try and gather as much information as possible, but there might always be something missing.
