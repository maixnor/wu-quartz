# Welcome

These are my personal notes, made freely (as in free beer and as in freedom) available to you.

# How to get around town

The root node is [[BBE]]. From there on branch out to the different lectures and its topics. Or you can use the powerful search to find notes or the content of notes directly.

# Contributions

Any and all contributions are welcome. Just text me on whatsapp or contribute directly with the below description. It does not matter if you want to contribute with your own notes or insights or I made a mistake. These notes live off of "peer review" through people like you. Also let me know if an external link is invalid.

To contribute navigate to the [Github](https://github.com/maixnor/wu-quartz/tree/main/content) and search for the file (top of page you are viewing) you want to edit. Then select this file and in the top right you will find the option to edit the file. Or if you want to create a new file select Add File in the top right immediately. Don't forget the file name :).

Once you are done editing hit commit changes and select `Create a **new branch** for this commit and start a pull request`. Then I will take a look at it and approve the PR. Then your contributions are live.


# Disclaimer
As these are personal notes everything might be wrong or outdated/irrelevant for any exam. I try and gather as much information as possible, but there might always be something missing.
