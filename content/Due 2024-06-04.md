Please post your questions/critical remarks relating to:

- DeMartino 2009. (In what way does globalization have an ethical dimension? What is the role of economists in this respect?
- Rodrik 2019. Globalization's wrong turn (video, talk of 45min, starting min. 4:30) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD-Ma7GViIk

# DeMartino
- leading economists not prepared for social ethics of globalization
- cross-border spillover effect of cultural conflicts/incompatibilities
- when saying "countries simply choose those standards that accord with the preferences of their inhabitant", do you mean e.g. China should just use child labor, because it is "preferred" by inhabitants? or at least less hostile against child labor then e.g. Europe
- concentric circles of moral obligation
- "once you can, you must" help others, thought-provoking 
- [[Dani Rodrik]] critiques free-trade, emphasizes ethics
# Rodrik
- talk by [[Dani Rodrik]]
- globalization is not binary (for/against, yes/no)
- [[Dani Rodrik#Rodriks Trilemma]]
- Globalization similar to Cold War - about co-existing peacefully, not about changing/destroying the other
	- adjusting and acknowledging differences and working with them - not against
