- EU decides what is green and what isn't
	- addresses [[Green Washing]] -> less approved
		- [[DWS Case]]
		- activists challenge green washing
			- rather honest 0% alignment than fake 10%
	- any kind of [[defense industry]] is not deemed as green
		- [[defense industry]] will face higher financing costs therefore 
- have to report on
	- Revenue
	- CAPEX
	- OPEX
- generates a percentage on how much money is used or made for/from green endevours
	- problems: 
		- perspectives change rapidly (e.g. is nuclear energy green or not?)
		- laws are slow to change (technological advancements may be too fast)
- collecting data on all subsidiaries around the world
	- digital infrastructure
		- data collection (finding out about data points)
