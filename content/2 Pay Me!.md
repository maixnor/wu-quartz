# Consumer Behaviour
### Consumer Preferences
- assumptions about preferences
	- complete -> consumer can compare options
	- transitivity: A > B and B > C -> A > C
	- non-satiation: more is better
	- convexity -> preference for variety -> [[Common Properties of Functions#Monotonicity]]
	- continuity -> [[Marginal Changes]]

### Budget Constraint
- income -> cannot spend more than you earn

### Consumer Choice
- [[#Utility Function]] captures preferences 
	- translating the sloppy terms "nice", "bad", etc into numbers -> easier to calculate
- Consumer wants to maximize [[#Utility Function]] under the Budget Constraint

### Consumption Bundle
- 2 resources
- each bundle is represented by x and y coordinates of each resource
- some bundles are unobtainable -> outside budget constraint

### Utility Function
- assigns value "Utility" based on x and y coordinates of a bundle
- ![[FM_Utility Function.png]]
- $q_1$, $q_2$ ... x/y coordinates of bundle
- $U$ ... Utility of bundle

### Indifference Curves
![[FM_indifference curves.png]]
- bundles which are "equal" -> same utility
- preferred bundles -> more of $q_1$ or $q_2$ or both increases utility -> farther from origin
- worse bundles -> less of $q_1$ or $q2$ or both decreases utility -> closer to origin
- no indifference curves intersect -> transitivity

### Convexity
- preference of variety
- ![[FM_convexity.png]]
- Combining A and B to produce optimal point C.
