When changing the inputs a tiny bit, how does the Output change?

How much does the output change, when input changes by 1%.
Taking a very small delta $\Delta$ which will change the price.
Then figuring out by what percentage the output changes.

converges to the derivative -> [[Derivatives]]
the "percentage" is the slope of the derivative

In many cases the curve will be [[Common Properties of Functions#Convexity & Concavity|convex]] -> promoting variety instead of extremes
In some other cases the curve will be concave -> promoting extremes
