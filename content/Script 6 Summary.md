# The Golden Age of Capitalism (Post-WW2)

## 1. The Golden Age in Long-term Perspective
- Rapid GDP per capita growth post-1945
- "Golden Age" characterized by convergence
  - Poorer countries growing faster by adopting tech/organizational practices of richer ones like the US
  - Catch-up growth observed notably in Western Europe and Japan

## 2. Postwar Recovery and Convergence on the US
- Massive growth due to postwar recovery
  - High pre-war investments, intact productive capacity
  - Fast recovery despite wartime destruction
- West Germany and Austria: significant GDP per capita growth
- Convergence indicator: Western Europe and Japan saw fast GDP increases relative to the US

## 3. Why Was Post-WW2 Recovery Different?
### a. Institutional and Social Factors
- Unlike post-WW1, Germany not punished with reparations
- Western Europe = cooperation + welfare state
  - ECSC, OECD to promote European integration
  - Marshall Plan aid conditioned on joint recovery efforts
- Enhanced labor-capital cooperation
  - Stronger trade unions and state role in economy

### b. Bretton Woods System
- Fixed exchange rate system; US dollar pegged to gold
- Created macro stability
  - Restricted capital mobility
  - Allowed domestic monetary autonomy
- Focus: avoid capital flow-induced depressions as seen in the 1930s

### c. Growth Accounting Framework
- Increased productivity:
  - Tech transfers, increased capital stock
  - Enhanced labor quality (human capital)
  - Structural changes: from agriculture to industry
- Boone from American mass production techniques, management styles

## 4. The End of the Golden Age
- 1973: End marked by first Oil Crisis and collapse of Bretton Woods
- Key reasons:
  - Almost completed convergence with US
  - Slowed structural transformation
  - "Eurosclerosis" limits European integration + trade growth
  - Inflation and US budget deficits under strain

## Associated Key Ideas
- Post-WW2 growth differently managed compared to post-WWI
- Bretton Woods â†’ monetary stability vs gold standard's rigidity
- Long-term capital mobility restricted; emphasis on trade stability
- Convergence driven by tech transfer, organizational practices, and structural change
