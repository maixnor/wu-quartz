Strategy ... the route we take to the peak

- there will always be something you did not think about
	- example [[Gatwick Drone Chaoes]]
		-> drones were not in the disaster plan of the Gatwick airport
	- example [[Angry Child of Krakatoa]]
	- example [[Christian Thielemann]]: [[There is too much going on]]
		-> every concert or opera is "wrong", but nobody notices anyways
	- example [[No Plan B OEBB]]

- what to do when there are not many resources to pull from -> [[Bricolage]]

- important to properly [[Scenario Development|develop scenarios]]
- cases of successful scenarios
	- [[Rolls Royce Case]]
	- [[NATO Case]]

- Undecidable Problems -> there are mathematically unsolvable problems

- Pavlov's Dog -> [[Conditioned Reflexes]]
	-> Pavlov mistakes ringing of bell for trigger of salivation
