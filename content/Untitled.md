NOTES: FRAGEN “Who has been to an airport before? Remember, how long did it take you to get through security? You probably felt a bit annoyed, just standing around, watching…”

FIND STATISTICS; Numbers eg “the average person waits X minutes at TSA”,…

**Opening: Engage and Intrigue**
"Imagine you're standing in a long, winding queue at the airport, watching precious minutes tick by as each passenger slowly moves forward. Did you know the average person waits around 23 minutes in airport security lines? Imagine what you could do in that time if you didn’t have to wait. I think we’d all rather have that time to do what we want, but realistically you just look at your phone whilst you wait, take a call, or a handful of other things, but is that really what you want to do? 

Maybe you start imagining like me, thinking about how Instead of aimlessly waiting, this process became a model of rapid movement, propelling you forward seamlessly and without stress.
Pause for a moment and consider—how would you redesign queuing at the airport if there were no limits to your imagination? What if, instead of standing around, you were swiftly guided through a streamlined process, leaving you more time to enjoy your journey?"

And that is just one example of the slow, cumbersome processes that exist everywhere in our lives—from bureaucratic red tape in government offices to slow-moving lines at coffee shops. Each of these moments, these bottlenecks in our daily routines and industries, are not just problems. They are potential pathways for innovation.

**Transition to Personal Story: Establish Credibility and Connection**
"My journey began with a similar frustration—seeing potential where others saw permanence. 

I remember sitting in front of my laptop, trying to plan a journey across Europe by train. The loading times were excruciatingly slow, the routes were ridiculously expensive, and unnecessarily indirect. Out of sheer frustration, I started researching the system I was using. Not surprisingly, I discovered it was built in the 90s, based on technology from the late 80s, and was still in use in 2022.

This realization was my wake-up call: transformation begins with the courage to challenge the status quo. I dove deeper, learning how these systems worked, their differences, and how they could be merged into one efficient, centralized, and accurate platform. From that day, I dedicated myself to reimagining how these systems operate, leading to the creation of a platform that reinvented European rail travel, turning it into a seamless and efficient experience. 

**Middle: Expand on the Big Idea**
"This platform was just the beginning of my realization. It exemplified how disruptive innovation can provoke systemic change — change that goes beyond mere incremental improvement and initiates a 'Deep Shift' in how we perceive and solve problems. Why is this necessary? Because in a world governed by routine, the inertia of habit stifles our growth, binding us to outdated methods and practices and makes us think almost only INSIDE the box.”

Consider the European rail travel industry, which had been talking about the need for a centralized platform for years if not centuries, yet never actually really challenged the status quo. Sometimes, it takes an outsider, a third party, to dive into an industry and disrupt it, to catalyze real change."

**Illustrate with Example: Make It Relatable**
“Think about how smartphones transformed communication. Two hundred years ago, it took weeks if not months to deliver a message to a faraway friend or family back home. Do you think most people seriously thought things could get much faster? Then, in the 19th century, after the telegraph cable was stretched from coast to coast in the 1850s, a message from London to New York could be sent in mere minutes, and the world suddenly became much smaller. Who would have thought! 

What about the telephone, radio, and TV? Just over the span of 200 years, we changed the time it takes to communicate to milliseconds, and the device we use to reach those times is most often merely the size of our palms. Now think how our world would be today if communication technology never changed. 

Imagine if the people never challenged their environment! Where would we be? And I do have to admit, this example is a very large disruption. But you can find such innovations in any part of your life.  

**Call to Action: Motivate and Empower**
"Which brings me to what I ask of each of you today. Look around you; be observant; identify something in your life or work that 'just works' and challenge it. Don’t settle for the status quo. Look at how you get to school or work, how you file your taxes, how you get food, how you got here even, and ask 'Why am I doing it this way?', 'How would I really like to do it?', and 'What if I can change it?' Embrace this mindset, and together, we can turn the ripples of today into the waves of tomorrow."

But how do we initiate this change? It starts with curiosity and courage. First, question everything. Don’t accept things as they are—dive deep and understand why they are that way. Second, educate yourself. Gather knowledge about the existing systems and their limitations. Third, ideate and innovate. Think creatively about potential solutions and don’t be afraid to dream big. Finally, take action. Start small, test your ideas, and be ready to iterate. Remember, innovation is a journey, not a destination.

And ideas aren’t enough to innovate. It's about acting on them. It's about not just dreaming of change but making it. Let's not wait for the future to dictate what we can do; let's dictate the future. Embrace the 'Deep Shift'—because the world doesn’t need more standbys; it needs more innovators."
