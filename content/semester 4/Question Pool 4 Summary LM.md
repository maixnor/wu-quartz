### **Principle of Falsifiability and Logical Analysis**

* **Principle of Falsifiability**
    * Serves as a demarcation line between:
        * Testable hypotheses and meaningless sentences.
        * Testable hypotheses and metaphysics/religion.
        * Testable hypotheses and pseudo-scientific statements.

* **Purpose of Logical Analysis**
    * To be useful for personal and public life.
    * To demonstrate correctness of modern mathematical logic.
    * **Not** to reduce everything to the laws of physics.

* **Vienna Circle**
    * A group founded in Vienna in the:
        * 1920s.

* **Demonstrating Falsifiability**
    * Requirements include:
        * Formulating a negation of the singular consequence.
        * Formulating the singular consequence.
        * Identifying the condition under which the hypothesis is true.

* **Deductive Inference Rules**
    * The Principle of Falsifiability utilizes:
        * Modus tollens.

* **Falsifiability vs. Verifiability**
    * Popperâ€™s objection to verifiability includes:
        * Validity of induction.
        * An all-sentence cannot be confirmed by observation.
        * The Verification Principle of Meaning.

* **Heidegger's Critique**
    * Criticized "Das Nichts nichtet" as being:
        * Nonsensical.

* **Basic Sentences According to Popper**
    * Used to:
        * Falsify the hypothesis.
        * Verify the negation of the singular consequence of the hypothesis.

* **Problems with Basic Sentences**
    * Popper notes that:
        * They cannot themselves be shown to be true.
        * Their acceptance relies on agreement or decision.

* **Hypothesis Consequences**
    * Consequences of a hypothesis can be:
        * General conditional.
        * Singular sentences.
        * Identity claims.

* **Popper on Induction**
    * According to Popper:
        * Induction is not justifying but developing a hypothesis.
        * There is no true induction.
        * Induction provides probable results.

* **Verification of Singular Consequences**
    * Means:
        * The hypothesis is shown to be verifiable.
        * The hypothesis is not necessarily verified.

* **Meaning of Positivism**
    * Refers to:
        * The Latin expression "positum".
        * The philosophy of the French philosopher Comte (positivisme).

* **Method of Logical Empiricism**
    * Involves:
        * Logical Analysis.

* **Principle of Verifiability**
    * According to Logical Empiricism:
        * Hypotheses are not true but probable.
        * The consequences of a hypothesis can be ultimately verified.

* **Protocol Sentences**
    * Defined as:
        * Sentences expressing the given in an unmediated way.
        * Conventions.

* **Pseudo-Scientific Claims**
    * A claim is pseudo-scientific if:
        * It cannot be falsified.
        * It does not state conditions for falsification.
