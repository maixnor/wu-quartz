My learning experience throughout the course and the relevance of the course content has been mixed. On the one hand I think the content provides a good baseline to support some basic understanding of the landscape within companies. On the other hand the concepts covered are mostly either outdated or simply not practiced in the real world. Although some aspects did surprise me positively.

My largest learnings are related to how business changed over time. Starting from the Silk road and going up through the ages to the current business landscape was insightful, not just for the content discussed but for applying some economic thinking to an otherwise very history-heavy subject matter. Usually the analysis of history focuses on important people and how they revolutionized some aspect, but here we focused on economic principles and how to evaluate the business landscape at the time.

The next large learning is how technology and economy of scale have truly changed how business is done. Especially how they emerged - or were at least largely influenced - by events like the Great Depression and the following rules and regulations that pushed businesses ever more to become international and technologically advanced powerhouses of production. Management has to adapt constantly to ever changing technological landscapes, which will be an ever growing challenge in the future.

Another thought on economy of scale: of course everyone and their mother has heard about the industrial revolution before. Still, the impacts on modern capitalism and how the "boom and bust" cycle emerged in the business world because of it was interesting. Almost everything has happened before, so it is wise to learn of others' mistakes and look at history to learn more about how to change the future.

My next topic I want to dive into is how cooperating with people in different cultures is like. Since toadys business world is more and more global and not only contact but cooperation with people from other countries and cultures is inevitable the knowledge of how to work with multi-cultural teams is crucial. The course showed me how to manage a broad-cultural team of people and what important cues I should keep in mind when analyzing problems in those environments. Of course managing a divers team is not easy and there is no one-size-fits-all solution for every situation. 

Mostly conflicts from intercultural interaction comes from people not understanding where the others are coming from and are unaware of conflicting lifestyles and cultural norms. Ignoring such differences can pose significant challenges and cause problems when ignored by management. Understanding different cultures is still something I have to cover myself, that is one of the reasons I have picked South America (specifically Peru) as the destination for my semester abroad. When I eventually launch my own company or startup I want to employ a diverse team, since the benefits of better solutions and decisions is definitely worth the slight hassle of working with people from other cultures, especially since I want to be working in a global markets.

Although it might sound simple, managing people from different cultures I suspect will be difficult, simply because one has to understand everyone's background.

It sounds simple, but managing a multicultural team means you gotta try and understand everyone’s background. Different places do things differently, and without some effort, things can easily get lost in translation. This realization kinda opened my eyes to the fact that when I’m in a leadership role someday, I have to be really careful about respecting these differences. It might make solving conflicts harder sometimes, but at the same time, it opens the door to seeing things from angles I never considered before.

Another crazy thing I noticed was the importance of technology in modern business. Throughout the course, I saw companies rely on digital tools to make their everyday jobs easier. Technology literally changes everything. Before, everyone used to meet face-to-face and work with papers; now, a lot of it is done online at the click of a button. This shift makes communication way faster and more global. I found it pretty cool but also kind of overwhelming because everything is moving at such a breakneck pace. It made me realize that to be successful in the future, I have to keep up with these ever-changing digital tools and ways of doing business.

This isn’t just about having fancy gadgets either. It’s about understanding that technology is a game-changer. Companies nowadays use everything from email to cloud computing to keep their teams connected, even when people are miles apart. In classes, we talked about how these tools can boost a business’s effectiveness, but also how they force managers to think differently. The whole idea pushes me to realize that flexibility is crucial; if you can’t adjust to new tech, you’re basically falling behind.

Also, learning about different management styles was a huge part of this course. It made me see a clear difference between old-school, “do it my way” management and the more modern, collaborative kind of leadership. The old style was all about barking orders and expecting everyone to follow, no questions asked. But now, managers are meant to engage with their teams and involve everyone in the decision process. I learned that being a good leader isn’t simply about giving out tasks—it’s about listening to people and supporting them. Managers should be more like coaches, pushing people to improve rather than just bossing them around.

It was interesting to see that with the change from authoritarian styles to more empowering ones, the workplace also becomes a more creative and innovative place. Knowing how to motivate people isn’t as straightforward as it seems. For example, we touched on motivational theories like Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs, which shows that for people to be happy and effective, their basic needs must be met before they can achieve higher goals. This theory made me think about the importance of making people feel valued on a personal level. I realized that if you don’t take the time to understand what drives your people, you might lose them, and that’s bad for morale.

The course also got into some pseudo-psychological ideas about how to motivate employees, and even though some of it felt a bit off, it still added to the overall picture. I picked up that managing isn’t just about the business side of things; it’s also about understanding the human brain and what makes people tick. Even if some of the ideas weren’t perfectly scientific, they pushed me to think about employees as people with emotions and needs, not just cogs in a machine.

Ethics in leadership was another big topic we covered, and it made me see that being a manager means more than just calling the shots. It’s really about building trust. If a leader isn’t ethical, trust crumbles, and that breaks the whole team dynamic. We saw plenty of examples where unethical decisions led to big problems for companies, and those case studies left a mark on me. I now think that if I’m ever in a position of power, I better be on my best behavior. It’s not just about achieving targets; it’s also about being honest and fair, which in turn helps create a work environment where everyone feels safe.

I gotta say, this course really made me look inward about how I handle relationships too. Before this, I used to think management was mostly about getting work done. Now I see it’s a whole lot more about the people behind the work. The way you treat your team can make or break an organization. I’ve started to see that I need to be more caring and less rigid if I want to do well in any future career. Creating a positive environment where people feel free to share their ideas is something I’ll definitely remember. It’s like, if your team trusts you, they’re gonna go the extra mile, and that can really set you apart as a leader.

When I think about the future and the kinds of jobs I might have, I see how useful these lessons are. I imagine myself stepping into roles where I have to not only manage the day-to-day stuff but also really nurture the people around me. The idea of using good communication and understanding team dynamics to solve conflicts is something that really stayed with me. I learned that dealing with conflicts isn’t always straightforward, but with the right approach, things can be resolved in a way that leaves everyone feeling heard.

Sometimes, conflicts come out of misunderstandings or miscommunication, so knowing how to handle that is a game-changer. The course taught me about different techniques for conflict resolution, like active listening and negotiation, which now seem super important if I ever have to manage a tricky situation. I think that if I can keep my cool and be open-minded during conflicts, I’ll be able to create a more relaxed and productive work environment. This whole angle of understanding and fixing conflicts really gave me a new perspective on what management should be.

I also got a sense that change is the only constant. The course stressed that business isn’t ever set in stone – everything’s always moving and evolving. I realized that if I don’t keep learning and staying on top of new trends, I risk being left behind. The fast pace of tech changes and shifting management trends means I have to be ready to change my approach constantly. There’s no room to be stuck with one outdated method if you wanna stay relevant. I need to be alert and flexible, always checking out what’s new and thinking about how it can fit into how I manage things.

Even though sometimes it felt like there was too much to keep track of, I think that being adaptable is a critical part of the job. New ideas and theories will keep coming, and I gotta be open to learning and trying them out, even if they don’t always make sense at first. I’ve come to believe that being successful in management isn’t just about knowing the ins and outs right now, it’s also about being ready to update your approach as time goes on. That’s kinda what the course drilled into me: never stop learning, because the world around you never stops changing.

Looking back, I’m kind of amazed at how much this course has shifted my view on management. I used to see it as a very straightforward thing – like, just give orders and everyone does what they’re told. Now, I see it as a complex mix of history, technology, psychology, and personal relationships. This new perspective has made me realize that the way companies work isn’t just about profits and efficiency, but also about the people who make it all happen. I mean, if you don’t take care of the people, nothing else really matters. It might sound simple, but it’s a lesson I know I’ll carry with me no matter where I end up working.

One of the biggest takeaways for me is that there’s no perfect formula for managing people. Every team is different, and every situation calls for a slightly different approach. What works for one company might not work for another if the people just aren’t the same. I know now that I have to be ready to tweak my style and adapt to the unique needs of each group I work with. This might mean sometimes trying out new ideas that aren’t fully formed or even making mistakes along the way, but that’s okay. The important thing is to keep trying and understand that perfection isn’t always possible in real life.

I really appreciate how the course pointed out that leadership is not about having all the answers. Instead, it’s about working with your team to come up with solutions together. This idea can be a bit messy sometimes, but it shows that no one is perfect. I realize that sometimes I’ll have to rely on the input of others and maybe admit I don’t know everything—being honest about that can make a big difference in how people respond and work together. It’s less about being a perfect boss and more about being part of a team that trusts each other enough to share ideas and build something together.

There were also moments where things got really practical. Like, when we discussed what happens during a conflict or when things go wrong in a team, it wasn’t all theoretical. We talked about real examples where managers messed up, and those examples really stuck with me. Seeing how a lack of understanding or failure to adapt could spiral into bigger problems was a wake-up call. Now, I feel like I have a better grasp on what I need to avoid if I ever find myself in a similar situation. That’s something I know I’ll remember every time I’m faced with a decision that might affect others.

Sometimes, the course felt a bit overwhelming with all the different ideas thrown in at once, but looking back now, I’m actually glad it did. I guess it made me realize that managing people isn’t something you can learn in one sitting or from one textbook. It’s something you constantly work on and improve with every little mistake and success. Every meeting, every disagreement, every new piece of tech that comes around—it all has a role in shaping how you lead. This kind of understanding is something I might not have gained if things had been too polished or too easy.

I also learned that trust is really hard to build but easy to lose. When you trust your team, they’re more willing to take risks, share ideas, and work really hard. But once that trust is broken, it can take forever to fix. This lesson is one I think is super important because it just shows that management is as much about emotions as it is about processes. I want to be someone who can build that trust quickly and keep it strong, even when things get tough. This idea of trust keeps coming back to everything we talked about in class, whether it was managing conflicts or just having regular, honest conversations with everyone.

At the end of the day, I feel like this course has really given me a roadmap for how I want to approach my future career. It taught me that being a manager isn’t only about being in charge or making decisions; it’s about being human, admitting when you don’t know something, and having the guts to change when you need to. I’m not coming out of this course thinking I’m suddenly a management genius. Instead, I’m coming out with the understanding that I have a lot to learn and a lot of mistakes to make before I can really call myself a good leader. And honestly, that’s okay.

I’m also really grateful for the parts about digital tools and technology. Even though sometimes it felt like the material was moving way too fast, I now see that being comfortable with digital platforms is absolutely critical. This isn’t just for the big companies; even a small business needs to make sure that it’s using technology right to stay competitive. This push to keep up with the latest software and apps might sound a bit overwhelming, and sometimes it is, but it’s also exciting because it means there’s always something new to learn that can really boost productivity.

This whole thing also made me think about the balance of work and life. Managing people isn’t just confined to office work—it spills over into personal life too. How you handle conflicts at work, or how you support your colleagues, can really affect your own well-being. I learned that if I want to be a good leader, I have to take care of myself so I can take care of others. That might mean setting aside time to learn, to reflect, or even just to relax when things get too intense. It’s a reminder that no matter how hectic it gets, maintaining a balance is key.

In other words, this course wasn’t just about theories and case studies. It was about preparing for real life, where nothing is perfect and adjustments are needed all the time. I now understand that being in charge isn’t simply about calling all the shots. It’s about being flexible, accepting help from others, and, most of all, being ready to change your approach when things aren’t working out. Even if that means making mistakes along the way, it’s all part of the process of growing and becoming a better manager.

When I think about how I’ll use all these lessons later on, I realize that every little bit of what I learned is going to stick with me. Whether it’s using a new tech tool, understanding a team member’s cultural background, or just knowing how to approach a problem calmly, I know that these ideas are going to be practical in my everyday work. I don’t expect everything to be perfect right off the bat, but I do believe that having this rough, real-world perspective on management is going to help me make smarter choices down the line.

In conclusion, the course on Managing People and Organizations has been a long, sometimes messy journey, but one that has left a big impact on the way I think about leadership and teamwork. I’ve learned that history, culture, technology, and ethics all blend together into a complicated but important recipe for running any kind of organization. While there aren’t any neat, clean answers, what there are is real-life experience – mistakes, adjustments, understanding, and most importantly, growth. I now see that being a leader isn’t a title you can just claim; it’s a process of learning and unlearning, of trying to do better and being open when you get it wrong.

I’m still far from having it all figured out, but I’m more ready than ever to take on the challenges of the business world. I know there will be days when things fall apart, when tech failures, cultural clashes, or ethical dilemmas make it all seem overwhelming. But I also know that every single mistake is just a lesson waiting to be learned. I’m coming out of this course with a sense of humility and a recognition that the best leaders are the ones who never stop learning, no matter how messy things get.

So yeah, that’s where I’m at now. I feel like I’ve got a decent idea of what managing people and organizations might look like—beyond just the glossy textbooks and pristine class notes. It’s real, it’s rough, and it’s often unpredictable. And that uncertainty is okay because it means there’s room to grow, room to adapt, and room to really become someone who makes a difference. With everything I learned about history, tech, culture, and ethics, I’m ready to try to be that kind of leader, even if the road ahead might be bumpy, messy, and full of surprises.
