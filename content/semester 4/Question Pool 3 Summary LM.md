### **Empiricism and Induction in Philosophy**
- **Philosophical Schools**
    - **Empiricism**: Dominant in 18th century England, emphasizing knowledge through sensory experience.
    - **Transcendental Idealism**: Contrasts with empiricism, developing later in philosophy.
	
- **Relations of Ideas vs. Matters of Fact**
    - Relation of Ideas: Statements that are necessarily true (e.g., "2 + 2 = 4").
    - Matters of Fact: Statements based on observation and experience (e.g., "The earth moves around the sun").
	
- **David Hume**
    - Regarded as an **Empiricist**, focusing on understanding knowledge through sensory experience.

- **Knowledge and Induction**
    - Induction: Inference that extends from observed to unobserved phenomena; conclusions are not entailed by premises.
    - Hume argues induction cannot justify future events based on past experiences.
    - Circular reasoning: The problem of induction questions whether past experiences can justify future predictions.

- **Hume's Critiques**
    - Beliefs about matters of fact cannot be justified by deduction alone; they rely on experience.
    - He characterizes causal relationships: observed but not conclusively known.
    - The truth of "2 + 2 = 4" is validated through conceptual analysis rather than empirical evidence.

- **Uniformity of Nature**
    - The principle asserts that future events will resemble past experiences.
    - Justifying this principle leads to an infinite regress, challenging the validity of induction.

- **Causation and Knowledge**
    - Causal connections cannot be perceived directly; they rely heavily on habitual association formed through experience.
    - Hume distinguishes between two types of knowledge: empirical (based on observation) and rational (dependent on concepts).

- **Skepticism about Knowledge**
    - Hume questions whether we can know anything about events beyond immediate experience.
    - He acknowledges that while we infer cause and effect from experience, these inferences may be unfounded.

- **Induction Process**
    - Inductive inferences are not truth-preserving; they do not guarantee conclusions derived from premises.
    - They rely on the assumption that nature is uniform.

- **Types of Sciences**
    - Hume classifies sciences based on the justification process: empirical sciences (based on observation) vs. rational theories.
