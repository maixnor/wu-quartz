# Why
> The Ability to pay is being taxed

anything which goes above and beyond the absolute necessities of living is taxed
# Types of Rates
- flat/linear -> equal tax rate with all income levels
	- Tax(Income) ... linear
	- has a somewhat degressive effect (below)
		- in this sense similar to [[VAT]]
- progressive -> increasing tax rate with increasing income levels
	- Tax(Income) ... exponential
	- redistribution effect
	- mostly standard, question is: How steep is the curve?
- degressive -> decreasing tax rate with increasing income levels
	- Tax(Income) ... logarithmic
- tax free region -> e.g. below certain income no additional tax is collected
# General
- less than 10% of earners contribute most of the income tax
- 30-40% are in special tax free region (Austria below 11.000)
- interesting coupling with [[Inflation]]
	- cold progression -> [[Inflation]] inflates the income levels
	- if tax laws stay the same, then same income level after inflation is lower adjusted for inflation since larger 
		- Billions of Income Tax increase
- tax brackets
	- various regions wherein a flat rate exists
	- [[Marginal Tax]] -> how is the next euro taxed
- family tax
	- individual tax -> no matter what family structure, individual is taxed
		- promotes part-time work
	- marriage split -> when married the income is split among both parties
		- e.g. in Austria and Germany
	- family/household tax -> complete family/household is added up and taxed appropriately	- family/household tax -> complete family/household is added up and taxed appropriately
		- promoted high fertility
		- individual income added up and divided by head count (even children)
		- e.g. in France -> a lot of French people don't pay income tax
