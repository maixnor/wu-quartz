# Externalities
## Definition
- doing something that affects anyone else in any way
	- neither pays nor receives any compensation
- negative vs positive externality
- externalities often not taken into account when making economic decisions
	- social cost / social benefit
## Externality Pollution
- for every unit of good produced a pollutant enters the atmosphere
	- social cost increases
	- equilibrium shifts along the demand line
- solutions for this issue
	- CO2 Tax -> most elegant solutions
	- Regulations, either a production cap or a price cap
- take social costs into account
## Correcting market failure
- social norms of moral behaviour
	- spitting on floor
	- throwing garbage on the floor
- charities
- self-interest
- social contracts

## Coase Theorem
- there is a dog, person A loves the dog, person B hates the dog
- love 1000, hate 700
	- social optimum -> dog should stay
- even if person B may throw the dog out, person B can be compensated by person A 
	- > 700 = 701 and greater
- prerequisite: free negotiation between parties
- just thought experiment
	- practical application almost impossible -> all people would need to agree on something
- why private solutions do not always work
	- one may lie
	- one may not be able to evaluate other estimate
	- asymmetric information -> not everyone has the same knowledge
- government intervention
	- command and control policies -> directly modify behavior
	- market policies -> takes that modify behavior
## Shared Socioeconomic Pathways
- #todo get image from slides
- Challenges to Mitigation 
	- Companies stay dirty
- Challenges to Adaption
	- #todo what is this?
- -> [[Jesus Crespo]] created a model to project GDP and GDP per Capita for **all countries** until 2100
	- Population projections from WHO
	- [[Population Pyramids]]
		- Assumptions for Projection
			- business and usual
			- e.g. Kenia will evolve as other countries have historically
	- #todo insert global projection from slides here
	- most important country for global population: Nigeria
	- population peak in Nigeria by 2080
		- previous projection was 2070 -> too optimistic, female education is not going as well as expected
	- new Data will be published in the [[COP]]24 
# Environmental Depletion
## Example of [[Deforestation]]
- also applicable to other metrics (air pollution, CO2 emissions)

- Core Question: How do rich countries changes when increasing its wealth? How is deforestation evolving?
	- first argument: richer -> more energy and space requirements
	- second argument: richer -> more care about natural environment and pretty places
- cheap answer: Forest Cover vs GPD per Capita 
	- relation: as GDP increases the forest cover decreases
	- first issue: [[Endogenuiy]]
		- causal effect not possible from simple question
	- laboratory solution
		- 2 comparable plots of land
		- give one plot to a poor country, the other plot to a rich country
		- after X years analyse the difference in land use
### Cross Border Deforestation
- Cross-Border Deforestation Index
	- https://pure.iiasa.ac.at/id/eprint/9056/
- Satellite Images for forest cover
	- difference trees from bushes and barren land
- measure Forest Cover from both countries close to border
	- issue: [[External Validity]]
	- across the border the regional difference in GDP per capita might not be as different as the rest of the country
	- borders are likely to run along a natural change in geography (e.g. mountain ranges)
	- land is not perfectly comparable on both sides of the border
	- solution: colonial borders -> straight lines
	- another issue: most areas with colonial borders forests are not a big thing
	- solution: another project mapping areas of homogenious response units:
		- same slope, terrain, resources across borders
	- after combining response units with deforestation data we have enough data points for a good experiment
		- Brazil vs Bolivia is good example
		- China: depending on which border the difference is great
		- Dominican Republic: Wild Fires during Slave Revolts decimated forest cover 
- Forest cover decreases until ~Brazils GDP per capita and increases from then onwards
