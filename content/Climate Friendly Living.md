- Point of no return will be reached soon
- experts expect 2 C or even 3 C
- carbon emissions are still increasing
- targets missed by miles - [[Juergen Essletzbacher]]

	- Provision Perspective -> providing things
		- providing systems to provide basic needs, not products
		- also lower-income households have access -> more people
		- need-based, not want-based
		- forces to think about what matters
			- use-value vs exchange-value
		- 
	- Market Perspective -> e.g. CO2 Tax (simple)
		- price, price, price
		- whats the price of a "ice bear" or the species "tiger"
			- many things are non-substitutable
		- fossil fuel subsidies are 7% of global GDP - IEA
	- Innovation Perspective -> e.g. fusion energy (expensive, complex)
		- all kinds of innovation 
		- exnovation -> stopping to do something
		- green transition
		- mission oriented innovation policies
		- social innovation
			- car sharing or urban gardening
	- society-nature perspective
		- nature is not something to dominate
		- with industrialization humanity decoupled from nature
		- personal freedom (revolt against)
		- sealing of soil -> more floodings (humans vs nature)
		- growth compulsion -> is it really good?
		- what can we give up? what cannot?
		- freedom tradeoffs -> freedom of one is limit to another
		- material flow needs to become ecological
		- ecology, planetary boundaries, social justice
- no decoupling of economic growth and energy usage

	- effective -> do what they should
	- feasible -> resistance to change by public must be low
