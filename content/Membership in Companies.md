## Duties and Rights
### Financial Duties
- duty to pay their contribution
- shares need to be payed to the company
	- if not the shares are re-sold on the market
- AG no additional payments necessary
	- except contracts between shareholders

### Duty of Loyalty
- "do not compete with own company in its line of business"
- no exact definition -> principles and guidelines
- interest of company not relevant in manager compensation
	- dividends are okay
	- not if liquidity is not sufficient
- standard -> spirit, rule -> wording
	- standard -> power with judges

### Financial Rights
- shareholder wants profits
	- voting rights just align with aim 
	- right to receive a dividend -> only if distributable profits
	- ratification (i.e. Is there distributable profits?) by AG -> board of supervisors, GmbH -> members
- profits distributed in accordance to financial investment
- receiving parts of [[Liquidation]] ([[Insolvency]])
- new shares (shares split) 
	- current shareholders need to receive extra shares (to stay at same relative ownership)
	- or current shareholders need to buy extra shares cheaper than rest to offset downsides

### Voting Rights
- shareholders free to exercise their voting rights
	- duty of loyalty 
	- equal treatment principle

#### Types of Shares
- one share on vote
	- each share has equal voting rights
	- double shares, double voting rights
	- only default rule, almost mandatory rule in AG
	- basis for hostile takeover
- one member one vote
	- shareholder (person) has equal voting rights
	- double shares, same voting rights
	- mostly applied in GmbH
- preferential shares
	- no voting rights
	- just financial rights (but dividend priority)
	- voting rights return after no dividends for 2 years
- voting caps
	- generally: double shares, double voting rights
	- a lot of shares -> still capped voting rights
		- 40% shares, but cap is at 10% voting rights (will receive 40% of profits)
	- deter large investors and hostile takeovers impossible

### Right to Information
- how vote without information?
	- asymmetric information
- AG: in annual meeting information can be forced from managers
	- otherwise not 
	- will likely comply anyway, their job is at stake
- information in GmbH widely available
	- threat: competitor buys 1 share and gets access to all trade secrets
	- limit here -> often before court

## Shareholder Resolution
### public limited company
- AG
- general meeting within 8 months
- extraordinary meeting if urgent (capital, merger)
- 28 days before announcement in "Amtsblatt"
	- slow, cumbersome
- strict Agenda
- notary presence
- shareholder -> right to participate 
- attendance low
	- large stakeholders attend
	- small stakeholder typically not -> [[Rational Apathy]]
	- if unhappy with company, most just sell -> [[Wall Street Rule]]
	- too expensive for institutional investors 
- measures to increase attendance
	- digital meetings -> error prone, falsifying result
	- proxy -> vote cast by third party
	- pressure -> violation in duty of care
	- proxy advisor -> advise company which vote(s) to cast

### private limited company
- GmbH
- more powers from voters
- less formalities than AG
- quorum of at least 10%
- written solutions permitable, but physical meeting may be requested

## Minority Stakeholder Protection
- [[Principal-Agent Conflicts#Majority and Minority Shareholders]]
- private benefits of control
	- control premium
- change in statutes: unanimous -> but can be only supermajority
- change in business line: unanimous
- blocking minority from 25% and up
- minorities may request higher supermajorities or stronger relative voting rights
- duty to justify -> treating shareholders equally, otherwise justification
- duty to loyalty - also to other shareholders
- every shareholder may bring claim against decision and to court -> risky

### Minority Rights
- call in meeting or append points to agenda
- request a special investigator (with 10% shareholder support)
	- investigator may see all books, can uncover violations

### Board Representation
- may appoint independent (from majorities) members of board of supervision
- independent members recommended with free float
	- >20% 1 member
	- >50% 2 members

## Tunneling
- [[Tunneling]] bad for minorities
	- form of hidden distribution
- "related party transactions" in general meeting
	- shareholder in benefit may not vote
	- determination if at arms length

## Transfer of Membership
- cannot sell shares back to company
- shares sold on market to exit company
### public limited company
#todo 
### private limited company
#todo 
### Involuntary Transfers 
- shareholders forced to transfer shares
	- [[Squeeze-Out]]
	- compensation based on [[Value of a Company|Company Value]]
		- hard to pinpoint value
- if no agreement can be found -> court, expensive and prolonged
- otherwise no other measure of forcing shareholder to transfer shares
	- exception GmbH: competition with company
