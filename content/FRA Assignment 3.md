# What is CSR?
- main objectives
	- spreading the sustainability requirements outside of EU borders
		- complete supply chain
	- steering investments towards environmental objectives
	- gathering information to base further directives / incentives upon
# Which firms CSRD?
- "large" ... more like middle sized (25 mil assets, 50 mil revenue, 250+ employees)
- uniform EU standards
- duties:
	- i guess revenues, CAPEX, OPEX
	- i guess machine readable format
# Double Materiality and implications
- [[Double Materiality]] involves externalities (effected and effecting)
	- effected ... by which external costs due to climate change am I infected
		- e.g. farmers don't have as much access to water -> watering costs rise considerably, maybe beyond earnings making farming unviable
	- effecting ... assessing which external costs are caused due to own actions
		- e.g. production produces a lot of e-waste which is offshored to 3rd world countries by waste handling company
- implication
	- taking a look at complete supply chain, exposing hidden externalities
	- making the previously only estimated concrete
# Assurance, main characteristics
- mandatory limited assurance for now -> [[Assurance#Limited]]
	- check for completeness
	- not for correctness
- mandatory reasonable assurance eventually -> [[Assurance#Reasonable]]
	- also check for correctness
