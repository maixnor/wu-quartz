### Task 1: Peruvian Bank's Risks

The Peruvian bank faces several risks due to its funding and investment strategies.

- **Liquidity and Interest Rate Risk:** There's a mismatch between the bank's short-term funding (6-month deposits) and its longer-term financing (2-year bonds and 3-year credit line), and long-term loans. This setup creates liquidity risk if depositors demand their money back quickly, and interest rate risk if interest rates rise, increasing the cost of funding without a corresponding increase in returns from loans.
- **Market Risk:** By investing in Peruvian stocks (industrial and mining sectors) and sovereign bonds from Brazil and Mexico, the bank is exposed to market fluctuations. A downturn in these markets could lead to significant financial losses.
- **Foreign Exchange Risk:** The bank's debt is in US dollars and Euros, but 70% of its commercial loans and all of its mortgage loans are in Peruvian soles. If the sol weakens against the dollar or Euro, repaying its foreign debt becomes more expensive.

### Task 2: Trade-Specialized Bank's Risks

This bank, focused on foreign trade, faces distinct risks.

- **Credit and Country Risk:** The bank's loan portfolio is concentrated on companies exporting to Argentina and Chile, exposing it to the economic and political stability of those countries. If Argentina or Chile face economic problems, the bank's clients may be unable to repay their loans. This is a form of **sovereign risk**.
- **Concentration Risk:** By focusing on a single sector (foreign trade), the bank has a high concentration of risk. A downturn in global trade would negatively impact a large portion of its clients simultaneously, leading to widespread loan defaults.
- **Operational Risk:** The bank issued a guarantee to a Peruvian importer, obligating it to pay a European supplier if the importer defaults. This exposes the bank to a potential loss outside its traditional lending activities.
- **Market Risk:** The bank's investments in Peruvian Sovereign Bonds and foreign ETFs (S&P 500 and DAX 40) expose it to fluctuations in the Peruvian, US, and German financial markets.

### Task 3: Banco de la Nación Case

This case involves a major theft at a state-owned bank branch9.

- **Involved Parties:** The primary entities are the **Banco de la Nación**, the implicated employees from the Cajamarca branch, and the recipients of social programs (Juntos and Pensión 65).
- **Case Details:** The issue was an internal theft of over 1 million soles from the bank's Cajamarca branch. The stolen funds were designated for social programs. The perpetrators were bank employees themselves, not external criminals.
- **Risk Type and Cause:** This is a clear case of **operational risk**, which stems from failed internal processes and people. The cause was internal fraud and theft, indicating a breakdown in the bank's controls and oversight.
- **Prevention:** To prevent this, the bank should:
    - **Strengthen internal controls** with surprise audits and transaction checks.
    - **Improve employee vetting** and provide ethics training.
    - **Implement better technology** for tracking transactions and monitoring unusual activity.

### Task 4: Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) Collapse

The collapse of SVB was a unique event caused by a specific set of circumstances.

- **SVB's Unique Features:** Unlike most banks, SVB's business model was highly concentrated on a single client segment: tech startups and venture capital firms. This led to a large volume of uninsured deposits from a few clients. On the asset side, a huge portion of its portfolio was invested in long-term, fixed-rate government bonds and mortgage-backed securities.
- **Factors Leading to the Collapse:**
    1. **Interest Rate Hikes:** The Federal Reserve's aggressive rate increases caused the market value of SVB's bond portfolio to plummet, leading to massive unrealized losses.
    2. **Tech Sector Slowdown:** As the tech sector cooled, many startups started pulling their deposits to cover expenses.
    3. **Bank Run:** Once news of the bank's losses spread, a swift, digital bank run ensued. The concentration of uninsured deposits in a single, interconnected community of depositors accelerated the panic and the withdrawals.
- **Principal Risks:**
    - **Interest Rate Risk:** The most significant risk. The mismatch between the bank's low-yield, long-term bond holdings and its short-term liabilities was a ticking time bomb that exploded when rates rose.
    - **Liquidity Risk:** This was the immediate cause of the collapse. The bank couldn't meet the surge in withdrawal requests without selling its devalued assets at a huge loss.
- **Regulatory Response:** Regulators took decisive action, guaranteeing all deposits (both insured and uninsured) to prevent contagion. The Federal Reserve also introduced the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) to provide liquidity to other banks. These measures were effective in restoring confidence and stopping the spread of the crisis.

### Task 5: Repricing Model

The Repricing Model is a tool used to measure how changes in interest rates affect a bank's

**Net Interest Income (NII)**. The model's core is the

**Repricing Gap**, which is the difference between a bank's rate-sensitive assets (RSA) and its rate-sensitive liabilities (RSL) over a specific time period.

ΔNII = Repricing Gap x ΔR

A positive gap means the bank's NII will increase when interest rates rise, while a negative gap means NII will fall when rates rise. Without the specific figures from the mentioned slide, the exact calculation can't be completed, but the formula remains the same.
