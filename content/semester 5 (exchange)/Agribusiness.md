- Strength: almost 600.000 tons production
- Weakness/Threat: almost no current exports, stark decline over the past years (especially 2023-2024 at -94%)
	- very expensive production costs
	- obviously people have done it before and stopped, likely due to logistics and international regulations
- Opportunity: large untapped pool of export products
