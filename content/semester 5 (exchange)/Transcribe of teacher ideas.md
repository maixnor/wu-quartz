### 1. Business Model Overview
* **Origins & Key model differences:**
    * **Airbnb:** peer-to-peer inventory generated by hosts (asset-light, supply-constrained) 
    * **Booking.com:** Aggregator of professional inventory (hotels, resorts, businesses) 
* **Key value proposition:** Hosts: additional revenue source - both rely on supply partnerships
* **Revenue model:** Commission-based, but with different take rates and payment structures.
* **User relationship:** How each platform builds and retains trust, identity, and a network effect.

### 2. Value Proposition & Customer Segments
* **Demand side:** Travelers/guests $\rightarrow$ experiential stays (**Airbnb**) vs reliability and convenience (**Booking**).
* **Supply side:** Incentives for hosts/property owners $\rightarrow$ visibility, pricing, control, revenue.
* **Network effects:** Cross-side and same-side effects: how liquidity drives growth. 
* **User journey differences:** From discovery to booking to post-stay experiences.

### 3. Recurrence, Retention, and Engagement
* **Recurrence** and **engagement** metrics (e.g., leisure vs business trips.
* **Retention strategies:** Loyalty programs (e.g. Booking Genius vs Airbnb's "Superhost" and "Superguest").
* **Trust building mechanisms:** Reviews, wishlists, messaging, personalization, trust systems.
* **Key Growth KPIs:**
    * DAU/MAU ratio
    * Booking frequency per user
    * Retention rate
    * LTV/CAC 

### 4. Supply Strategy and Liquidity Management
* **Supply side:** Challenges of managing long-tail supply, host education, Superhost programs.
* **Booking.com:** Professional supply partnerships, dynamic pricing, advanced risk management.
* **Matching efficiency:** Search algorithms, availability calendars, and conversion optimization.

### 5. Geographical and Segment Expansion
* **Global presence** vs **key focus markets** (travel, "Airbnb Rooms").
* **New services:** Flights, attractions, taxis, full-travel bundle ("connected trip" vision).
* Which platform can expand more effectively?

### 6. Monetization and Financial Performance
* **Commission rates** and fee structures.
* **Cost structure** and marketing spend (Booking's heavy paid acquisition vs Airbnb's organic growth).
* **EBITDA margins**, profitability, and scalability comparison. 

### 7. Trust, Brand, and User Ownership
* How each platform builds **trust** (reviews, verifications, cancellation policies).
* **Brand positioning:** "Belong anywhere" (Airbnb) vs "Book-ing-yeah" (Booking.com).
* **Ownership** of user relationship: Who "owns" the traveller, the host, or the platform?

### 8. Future Outlook
* How are both evolving?
    * **Airbnb** $\rightarrow$ focuses community integration, experiences, and long-term rentals.
    * **Booking** $\rightarrow$ toward a super-app for travel (multi-product offerings).
* Which model is more defensible in the long run?
