# Definition
- divide into entry fee and usage fee
	- entry fee payed only once
	- usage fee payed continuasly
- high entry, low usage
	- e.g. disney world -> 85$ upfront, rides are free
- low entry, high usage
	- e.g. prater -> entry free, rides are 5-20$ each
- how to maximize
	- set entry price to marginal cost
	- set usage fee to demand
## Multiple Groups
- either limit yourself to just one group
	- set entry fee p* to MC
	- set usage fee T* to area between MC and Demand
- or
- adjust according to the lowest group
	- otherwise consumers in lowest group is not willing to pay
	- then extract more via the usage fee
$$\pi = \text{entry fee} + \text{maximum profit 1} + \text{maximum profit 2} - \text{MC} * \text{combined profit 1 and 2}$$
$$=(15-p^*)^2 + (p^* - 1)(35-2p^*) \Rightarrow \text{maximize } p^*$$
- rule of thumb:
