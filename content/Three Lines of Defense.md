### General Notes
- in general management has to make sure that the audits are in place and working
- 3 lines of defense not present in smaller companies
	- per 1.000 employees there should be an auditor
		- depends on business model (can be as low as 1 per 40 employees)
- governing body
	- is my customer a terrorist?
- management
	- risk management
	- e.g. [[4 Eye Principle]]
	- internal control system
	- compliance management
- internal audit 
	- what is audited?
	- how is it audited?
	- what routines exists?
	- importance should not be understated
	- can also be done by external service
	- direct communication with supervisory board
		- e.g. CFO does something wrong -> communication through management board would be leaky and low
