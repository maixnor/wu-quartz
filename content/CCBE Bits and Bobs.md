# A Tiny Introduction to Economics
[[Macroeconomics]] ... using statistics to understand reality
[[Microeconomics]] ... looking at specific groups and their decisions
## Definition
>The study of how society makes choices in managing its scarce resources and the consequences of this decision-making

Issues like
- scarcity and choice
- trade-offs and [[Opportunity Cost]]
- marginal thinking ([[Marginal Changes]])
- incentives and reaction to them

Scope:
- which policy measures recude unemployment?
- how should central banks conduct monetary policy?
- how can we avoid that firms pollute the environment?
- why do people become criminals?
## Examples
### The impact of legalized abortion on crime.
Theory: With legalized abortion the crime rate decreases because the people that are not born, would later in life become a criminal with a higher chance. 

Great example because:
- a lot of variability for 50 different states
- a lot of data on other aspects of this problem 
### Oil and the duration of dictatorships
Theory: Dictators with a lot of natural resources should have longer duration in their dictatorships, since they have more resources to burn through to keep the people happy.
### Up or Down? Toilet Seat Etiquette
a mathematical system about if it is worth it to always put down the toilet seat after peeing.
### On the efficiency of ACDC
- Bon Scott had a nice voice which was the signature part of the band
- Bon Scott died of alcohol
- They found Brian Johnson, a very similar voice
- huge controversy about who was the better vocalist

They did:
- played an [[Ultimatum Game Experiment]]
- game was played in 2 rooms separately
	- one room played music from Bon Scott
	- one room played music from Brian Johnson
- Scoring: Which got more total income (accepted offers) 
- Brian Johnson Music won
# Scarcity and Choice
- economic activity: interaction between households and frims
- households cannot meet all wants and needs
- scarcity: society has limited resources, cannot meet all needs of all people
- how to best allocate resources for best meeting of needs/wants
# Trade-Offs
- trading off benefits/costs of options
- at societal level are different trade-offs
# Marginal Thinking
Revenue $R(x)$ and Costs $C(x)$

let profit be a function:
$\pi (x) = R(x) - C(x)$

then we can maximize the function (derivative = 0)
$\frac{d\pi (x)}{dx} = \frac{dR (x)}{dx} - \frac{dC (x)}{dx} = 0$
-> [[Optimization]]

This model requires *rationality* of all participants.

Marginal Quantities: When changing the inputs a little, how does the output change.

Finding a way that the marginal revenue matches their marginal costs. Then their profit is maximized. -> [[Optimization]]

# Popper Logic
Science vs Pseudo-Science

For something to be scientific it needs to be 2 things
- logically consistent
	- if it rains, the floor gets wet
- needs to be falsifiable
	- theory: all swans are white
	- how to falsify: find a non-white swan
	- if I can't find a white swan
		- "I cannot falsify the theory yet"
		- but the theory is not proven
# Cause and Effect
Pattern Matching is used to derive insights from data.

Then we search for causality and implications of these patterns 
# Positive vs Normative Analysis
- Why is unemployment higher for teenagers than older workers?
- What should the government do to improve the well-being of teenagers?

Positive Statement ... Can be falsified ... scientific statements
Normative Statement ... includes opinints ... cannot be tested

Positive and Normative tend to get mixed up.
# Critical Thinking
6 rules of evidental reasoning (Lett, 1990)
- Falsifiability
- Logic
- Comprehensive
- Honesty
- Replicability
- Sufficiency
#wontfix get rest from slides
# Occam's Razor
When there are 2 hypotheses that explain the situation equally well, then choose the simpler one.
# Logical Fallacies
- Ad hominem
	- oh no, that guy is a nazi, therefore the statement must be wrong
- Argument from authority
- Appeal to ignorance
- Post hoc, ergo propter hoc
	- just because one thing happened after another doesn't mean, that they cause each other
# OWID's classification
How to separate countries into different continental groups. This allows to distinguish between continental differences compared to country or region based differences.
