# Taylorism
- movie by Charlie Chaplin about [[Taylorism]]
- dehumanization of labor
	- work has not purpose from workers perspective
- high need for coordination
- [[Adam Smith]] example: Pin Factory
- monotonous work, dull routines

# Hawthorne Studies
- 1920s
- studies to optimize job performance
- hawthorne factories -> early telephones
- experiments with light intensity
	- treatment and control groups
	- interviews with workers
	- more productive with higher light intensity
	- but also more productive in the control group
	- actual reason was the experiment itself
		- workers were treated as humans
		- researchers were kind to the workers
		- workers thought they had a purpose
- hawthorne discovered that **people cannot be optimized indefinetely** 
- hawthorne discovered [[Humanistic Strategy]] 

# Organization Design
### Unitary Form
- like the Organigram of [[Post]]
- enduces collaboration and innovation between departments
- only one [[profit and loss statement]]
	- cannot distinguish income between products
- great for [[Process and Production Perspective#Pipeline vs Platform|Platform]] businesess

### Multidivisional From
- from General Motors
- each car got a separate [[profit and loss statement]]
- creating incentives to work harder and achieve profits
- creating competition within the organization
- CFO will only allocate resources to projects/products
### Tribe Form
- squad -> 10 ppl
	- each squad can think of what to do
- tribe -> 15 squads
	- each tribe had duties
- creates a "fail fast" culture
- high autonomy, flexibility, self-determination, self-organization
