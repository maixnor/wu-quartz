# Article 102 TFEU
- Keywords
	- abusive behavior
	- one or more undertakings
	- dominant position on relevant market
	- affect trade between member states
	- affect trade on competition
- abuse is an objective concept -> intention does not matter
- influence to structure of a market
- enforced by European Commission + 27 national competition authorities
- enforced Ex post
### Effect on Trade
- in one or more member states
- there are "Guidelines on the effect on trade concept"

### Effect on Competition
- same us under [[Competition Law#Article 101 TFEU - Anti-Competitive agreements|Article 101 TFEU]]

## Relevant Market
- how to define the relevant market?
	- product market and geographic market
	- product market -> interchangeable products (demand/supply substitutes)
	- geographic market -> geographic reach of company (local to whole Europe)
		- not just where companies are, but also where they could be in 1 year
- [[Market Definition Notice (2024)]] - European Commission

## Dominant Position
- presumed from market shares of 50% ([[AKZO Case]])
	- in very dynamic markets even 80% may not be dominant (e.g. nobody uses Skype anymore)
	- lowest dominant position by market share was 39% -> lower is possible
- other indicators:
	- Economies of scale/scope
	- fixed costs (R&D, marketing)
	- [[IPR]]s
	- structural barriers (digital ecosystems)
	- no countervailing buyer power

## Abusive Behavior
- unfair purchase/selling prices
- limiting production, markets, or technical development
- dissimilar conditions to equivalent transactions
- typing #todo find out more about that

- exploitative abuse vs exclusionary abuse
	- exploit -> let them live and benefit off of their lower market power
	- exclusion -> e.g. predatory pricing -> goal to eliminate competitors
- [[Rebates]]
- [[Tying]] and bunding
- [[Predatory Pricing]]
- refusal to supply & [[Margin Squeeze]]
	- dominant players might be forced to supply everyone

## Cases
### Microsoft 2004 Case (Tying)
- market: PC operating systems (Windows)
- effect on the market: tying media player to OS
	- basically pre-installed app with further barriers to installing new ones
	- status-quo bias
- justification: no objective proof that media player is better than others
- fine: 497 million

### Broadcom 2019 (Predatory Pricing)
- market: global baseband chipsets
- effect on the market: preventing competition, stifling innovation, reducing consumer choice
- fine: 242 million

## Consequences
- fines of up to 10% of previous year's turnover
	- normally at 0.1% located -> much higher fines possible
- order to stop infringing behavior
- damage claims
- loss in reputation

- [[Additional Markets Act]] -> dealing with [[Gatekeepers]]

# Merger Regulation
- only enforced by European Commission -> nationals have no control
- Merger Regulation 139/2004 ([[EUMR]])
- Ex ante investigation -> prospective analysis, notifications of companies merging
	- only after approval of Commission is the merge legal

## Analysis under [[EUMR]]
### Jurisdiction 
- concentration
	- change of control (not necessarily ownership)
	- control ... decisive influence
		- positive control: taking decisions about company
		- negative control: hinder company from taking decisions (e.g. veto)
	- sole control vs joint control (only a handful of companies together)
		- no definite % of shares mentioned
- union dimension 
	- Paragraph 2
		- more than 5 billion in worldwide turnover after merger (both/all companies together)
		- **and** union-wide turnover is more than 250 million **each** of at least 2 undertakings
		- **unless** each undertaking achieves more than 2/3 of turnover in same country -> national issue, not EU issue
	- Paragraph 3
		- combined worldwide turnover of 2.5 billion
		- **and** at least 3 member states combined turnover is over 100 million
		- **and** each individual turnover is over 25 million of at least 2 of them
		- **and** union-wide turnover of at least 2 is above 100 million
		- **unless** each undertaking achieves more than 2/3 of turnover in same country -> national issue, not EU issue
	- How to decide
		- gather enough information on turnover stats regarding worldwide, union and local
		- setup table with information
		- try and exclude -> everything which cannot be excluded is included
- between EU and non EU undertakings
	- EU can block the merger from the EU side (EU company may not merge) -> therefore merger is blocked entirely
	- EU and other authorities may have conversations
		- if no agreement is found the merger is blocked by either side or both

### Substantive Analysis
- [[SIEC Test]] -> is the position dominant after a merger?
	- (i) SIEC - dominance (unilateral effects)
	- (ii) SIEC - collective dominance (coordinated effects)
	- (iii) SIEC - other than dominance (unilateral effects)
- other factors
	- degree of contentration of the relevant market
		- 3 to 2 merger not appreciated
	- level of market share held by parties
	- competitor relations
	- opportunities to switch suppliers for customers
	- #todo finish list
- horizontal vs vertical mergers -> same as with horizontal vs vertical Agreements
	- horizontal mergers: concentration measure
		- [[HHI Herfindahl Hirschmann Index]]
		- Horizontal Merger Guidelines (2004)
		- sum of all squared market shares before and after the merger
	- procedural aspects #todo 
		- [[one-stop-shop principle]] -> going **only** to the highest authority 
	- remedies
		- may not be suggested by commission
#### Telering Case (Maverick)
- Telering was bought by T Mobile
- Telering was a [[Maverick]] -> Keeping prices down so that the large players cannot increase prices excessively
