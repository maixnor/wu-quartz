# Perfectly Competitive Market
- price taking
	- a lot of firms on market
	- each firm has small market share
	- no price setting power within individual firm
	- each firm takes market price as given
- product homogeneity
	- perfect substitutions between products
	- no firm can raise price beyond market price realisticly
- free entry and exit
	- no entry or exit costs -> suppliers easily enter/exit market
	- buyers can switch between suppliers easily
- **FULL INFORMATION**
	- no [[informational asymmetries]]

## Price Elasticity
- Firm has to take market price as given

## Profit Maximization 
- [[Profit Function]]
	- $q$ ... Quantity
	- $\pi(q) = R(q) - C(q)$
	- $\Pi' = 0$
	- $MR(q) = MC(q)$
- Marginal Revenue -> [[Marginal Changes]]
	- $p = MC(q)$
- Second order condition:
	- $\Pi'' < 0$ ... must be a maximum -> otherwise solution does not make sense
	- Profit function must be concave

### Graphical Solution
- finding largest difference (distance) between revenue function (linear, red) and costs (black, curved)
![[Micro_Profit Maximation.png]]

## Demand Curve
- 

### Graphical Solution
- red area -> loss of producing more or less than optimal quantity
- have to ensure that producing at the best conditions is better than shutting down
	- saving on fixed costs outweighs the opportunity cost
	- if fixed costs cannot be saved, then operating normally is more beneficial
- ![[Micro_maximum_profit.png]]

## [[Shut Down]] Rules
- if fixed costs are sunk -> [[Past Sunk Cost]]
	- cannot shut down easily, producing is still better than stopping
- if fixed costs can be recovered / saved -> closing is feasibile

### Graphical Solution
- own Average Variable Cost must be below industry minimum Average Variable Cost
	- Otherwise there could never be a profit
## Industry Supply
- aggregation of all suppliers 
	- summing up
# Equilibrium
- [[Equilibrium]]
	- market clearing price reached -> optimal price
	- no excess supply -> optimal supply
## Long Range Equilibrium
- equilibrium has been reached
- now increase in demand (e.g. change in taste)
- positive profits lead to new players enter the market
- new players means increased supply and lower prices
- lower prices result in zero profits
- equilibrium reached again

- can be run equally for decrease in demand
- profit in the long run is 0
- only supply and demand change, price will not
## Competitive Equilibrium
- if costs are ... then the long-term supply function is ...
	- constant -> horizontal
	- increasing -> increasing
	- decreasing -> decreasing ([[Economy of Scale]])

## Short vs Long Term Equilibrium
- short term
	- $P = MC$
	- Average Variable Cost is lower limit of price, otherwise shutting down

- long term
	- $P = MC > AC$ (profitability attracts more firms)
	- supply increases, prices fall, until $P = AC$
	- equilibrium reached -> zero profits in long term

## Zero Profit Condition
- does not mean that there is no money to be made
- competitive firms are compensated for opportunity costs
- there is no superior investment alternative for them
	- no use selling the business and going after a more lucrative business
- [[Opportunity Cost]] is important
	- implicit costs, fictitious employers salary, lost rent revenue

# Welfare Characteristics
- 2 parties: Suppliers (Firms) and Consumers
	- Consumer Surplus vs Supplier Surplus
	- what each party gets from the interaction
- Supplier Surplus = Profit
- [[Pareto Efficiency]] -> maximization of welfare
	- welfare ... supplier and consumer surplus
- no definition about distribution of surplus
- one being better off is at the cost of the other
- any [[Market Failure]] leads to efficiency loss

## Maximum Price
- price ceiling can only be effective if below equilibrium price
	- otherwise still equilibrium price -> no effect of policy
- supply is restricted, demand increases
- producers are hurt, since less producer surplus
- [[Deadweight Loss]]
	- Total Surplus is less than before
- consumer surplus is greater than supplier surplus
	- if consumer surplus is greater than without policy (at cost of producer surplus) then consumers are effectively better off, otherwise just worse for everyone
	- again: possibility of hurting both suppliers and consumers
- especially with highly inelastic products
	- drugs (additive as well as medical)
	- housing
	- basic food items (potatoes, bread, rice)
## Minimum Price
- e.g. minimum wage, essential tax on alcohol, tobacco
- price floor can only be effective if higher than equilibrium price
	- otherwise still equilibrium price -> no effect of policy
- demand decreases, supply increases
- suppliers (workers) are hurt, since less suppliers surplus
- overall welfare decreases
## Price Support
- government as another consumer -> increases demand
- consumer surplus decreases
- producer surplus increases
- overall welfare has increased
	- still a [[Deadweight Loss]] since Government pays for more than is gained globally
## Production Quota
- maximum quantity to be produced
- companies would like to produce more, but cannot
- consumer surplus decreases
- producer surplus increases 
- overall welfare has decreased
- governmental payments for voluntary production restriction
	- larger than overall surplus loss
- [[Deadweight Loss]] again
## Import Quota
- maximum quantity to be imported into country
	- trade restriction
- results in lower price -> market will adjust to price change
- consumers surplus increase
- producer surplus decreases
## Import Tariff
- bridge between domestic and world market price
- limiting imports -> less imports than without tariffs
- producers will supply more, consumers will demand less
- government will receive tariff amount
- [[Deadweight Loss]] (potentially) again
## Examples
- [[Lump-Sum Taxes]]
	- e.g. taxes on profits
	- #todo copy math from slides
	- $p = MC(q)$
- [[Taxes on Consumption]]
	- e.g. VAT
	- analogous to decreasing the price, similar to [[#Maximum Price]]
		- 2 prices, 1 which consumers are paying, 1 which producers are producing with
		- government receives quantity * tax
		- overall loss of welfare -> [[Deadweight Loss]]
	- #todo copy math from slides
	- $p - t_2 = MC(q)$
## 4 Conditions
- Quantity sold and buyers price, $P_D$ must be on the demand curve
- Quantity sold and sellers price, $P_S$ must be on the supply curve
- $Q_D = Q_S$
- $P_b - P_s = Tax$
## Incidence of a Specific Tax
- demand is inelastic -> tax burden on consumers
- supply is inelastic -> tax burden on suppliers
- $\text{Tax burden on consumers in \%} = \frac{E_s}{E_s - E_d}$ 
- $\text{Tax burden on consumers in \%} = \frac{E_s}{E_s - E_d}$ #todo for suppliers from slides
## Subsidy
- government pays some part of the price
- increases demand
- [[Deadweight Loss]] again
