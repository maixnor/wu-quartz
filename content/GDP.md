> Gross Domestic Product

- sum of all Products and Services produced in a country
	- includes also government spending
	- does not include intermediate products
		- is there something like an "intermediate service"?
- good indicator - not a measurement - of economic development

# Real vs Nominal
- real GDP takes inflation into account
	- [[Discounting]] i.e. past GDP is higher
- nominal GDP works with absolute values

#todo

## Income Method
- wages: 80 + 70 = 150
- profits: 20 + 30 = 50
- total income: 150 + 50 = 200

## Value Added Method
- if it is taxed by [[VAT]] it is counted towards 
- steel: 100
- car: 200 - 100 = 100
- total income: 100 + 100 = 200

# Shortcomings
- does not take [[income inequality]] into account
	- [[Inequality]] and [[Poverty]]
	- [[Income#Types|Income Types]]
- [[black market]] and [[Unpaid Work]] is not part of GDP
