A person living on below 2.10 USD (2023) per day (1.90 USD in 2022)
## What is Poverty?
> Austria is richer than Uganda. True of False?

This discussion is about measurements.

[[GDP per Capita]] is higher in Austria than in Uganda
Poverty rate is lower in Austria than in Uganda

Uganda has more Gorillas, they are winning there

### Growth from Space
Satellites have taken images every 14 days. They captures how much light is emitted by individual countries.

Light Emittence can be linked to [[GDP per Capita]] 
Great tool for evaluating the GDP and Poverty Rate of e.g. North Korea
After this research North Korea is the 3rd poorest country with a poverty rate of 60%. 

Study from [[Henderson]]

### Growth from Open Source
Data Sources
- Open Street Map (Development of roads/infrastructure) 
- Street View (size of doors because of refrigerators)
- Night Light Photographs
- Day Light Photographs
- NASA Data

### Growth based on GDP
richest: 
- Oil based -> rich but not growing
- Norway, Singapore -> grown rich from being poor

poorest:
- sub-saharan countries -> still getting poorer

## Inequality
With the [[GINI Index]] we can approximate the complete inequality of a country with its complete income distribution.

### Combating Poverty
Economic Growth ([[GDP per Capita]]) is good for the poor.

Income inequality is, from empirical data, not influencial when moving people out of poverty.

Different to [[Trickle Down Idea]]

### ISLM
the [[ISLM Model]] is used to model how the [[GDP]] changes from one year to another. A short-term model compared to the long-term methods mentioned previously.

$GDP = C + I + G + X - M = C + I + G + NX$

$I$ ... Investments (private and companies)
$G$ ... Government Expenditure
$C$ ... Consumption (private Individuals)
$X$ ... Exports
$M$ ... Imports
$NX$ ... Net Exports

Assuming a closed consumption: $NX = 0$

#### Consumption $C$
a function defined on disposable income: $f(Y^D) = f(Y - T)$
$T$ ... Taxes
$c_0$ ... "substistence" consumption (base consumption)
$c_1 \in (0,1)$  ... (marginal) propensity to consume when income increases

with a linear model we end up with: $C = c_0 + c_1 * Y^D$

$1 - c_1$ ... investment rate (because one can either spend or save income)
#### Investments $I$
[[Exogenous Number]]
#### Government Expenditure $G$
[[Exogenous Number]]
would be dependent on taxes ... not in this model tho

### Putting it all together
$GDP = I + G +c_0 - c_1 * T + c_1 * Y$
#### Equilibrium
aggregate demand = aggregate supply
$GDP = Y$
This will be a classic $y=x$ line

Where both lines meet the equilibrium is located

### Transformations
$Y^* = \frac{1}{1-c_1} (I + G + c_0 - c_1*T)$

more government expenditure -> $GDP * \frac{1}{1-c_1}$
$\frac{1}{1-c_1}$ ... multiplicator, [[fiscal]] factor

more taxes -> $GDP * \frac{c_1}{1-c_1}$
$\frac{c_1}{1-c_1}$ ... fiscal factor for taxes

### Paradox of Thrift
- when saving more (decrease $c_0$) the GDP decreases in the short run
- but the savings will finance the long-run development
[[Ricardian equivalence theory]]

### Fiscal Multiplier
There are economies where the fiscal multiplier is smaller than 1.
