SIEC ... Significant Impediment of Effective Competition
Applies to [[Art 101 TFEU]] and [[EU Merger Regulation]]

• **S**: Does the agreement have a significant impact on competition in the market or markets concerned?  
• **I**: Is the agreement likely to eliminate or significantly restrict competition in the market or markets concerned?  
• **E**: Even if the agreement does not eliminate or restrict competition, is it likely to lead to a significant impediment of effective competition in the market or markets concerned?  
• **C**: Can the agreement be justified by objective considerations?

The SIEC Test is used to assess whether an agreement or practice infringes Article 101(1) TFEU (prohibiting anti-competitive agreements).
