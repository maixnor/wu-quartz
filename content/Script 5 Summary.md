# First World War (1914-1918)
- social and economic costs
- war kills people -> destroying human capital
- wiped out 3 years of economic development
	- world [[GDP]] of 4 trillion
	- 8 trillion lost due to damages 
	- 4 trillion lost due to human capital loss
- disrupted international trade/markets
- high national debt
- new countries (e.g. Poland) -> new borders with new conflicts
- attempts of "going back to pre 1914" failed
	- overshot on fighting inflation
- new societal and political notions/changes
	- autocratic regimes less popular
	- new parties on right and left

## Spanish Flu
- 17-50 million killed
	- especially in poor countries
- no identifiable tradeoff between saving lives and saving the economy
- governmental changes
	- emphasis on health and social services

## War Finance
- no established mechanisms for financing multi-year wars
	- first of its kind
- methods of government getting money
	- higher taxes (revenues)
	- internal public debt - borrow from population -> [[Bond]]
	- external public debt - borrow from other governments
	- print money -> [[inflation]], [[Gold Standard]] abandoned
		- inflation devalues domestic debt, convenient
- protectionism hinders cooperation and global transactions
- winners wanted losers to pay for all damages
	- Germany forced to pay 260% its GDP in damages
	- Germany did not pay -> occupation by allies
	- then Germany [[Hyperinflation]] in 1923
		- [[Hyperinflation]] makes exchange rates difficult
	- new negotiations -> only pay back 40% of GDP until 1988
		- not happening, because WW2

### Debt Chain

# Postwar Stabilization
- return to [[Gold Standard]]
	- figured out [[Gold Standard#Self Stabilizing Mechanisms]]
	- limit of interest rates -> might depress economy
	- dependent on trust in the gold standard
		- many core countries were not trusted, had to build trust again
			- tight monetary policy
			- no money printing
			- intependent central banks
			- balanced government budgets
		- if [[IS-LM Model]] did not have monetary and fiscal policy, since need to abide the rules, available during crisis the model fails
			- [[Macroeconomics]] only invented after this period
