# Effects of Wealth Taxes
- real wealth taxes are not in fashion
	- decline in wealth taxes
- not a problem on individual wealth, but on corporate wealth
	- company A is not profitable every year
	- might suffer huge losses in individual year
	- might have to close if there is no wealth (equity) to keep the company running
- individuals rarely experience losses

# Inheritance and Gift Tax
- handing over wealth to the next generation
- generational equity
	- just because your parents were rich you should not be able to have this privilege alone
	- again a rebalencing effort
- Austria has no inheritance and gift giving tax (since ~2010)
	- due to strong inclination to family-owned businesses in central Europe

# Real Estate Transfer Taxes
- selling / buying a property, typically a low percentage, but still relevant
	- in Austria 3.5% 
- popular because it is extremely easy to enforce
	- in most countries you are not even registered as the owner if not paying the transfer tax
- also hitting mostly the people which are able to buy a house
- [[Owners vs Tenant Society]]
