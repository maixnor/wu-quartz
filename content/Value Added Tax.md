- related to [[VAT]]
- related to [[VAT Fraud]]
	- very easy to do fraudulent stuff
# Harmonization in EU
- [[V80]] directive of [[EU]]
- why is harmonization so important?
- without harmonization there would be so severe double taxation, then the internal market would not function
# Nature
- general consumption tax
	- every purchase involves [[VAT]]
- indirect tax
	- tax burden is passed on to the next person until the final consumer (us) bear the [[VAT]]
	- [[VAT]] is a [[Withheld Tax]] for the consumer
		- withholding party needs to pay [[VAT]] to tax authorities
	- companies never bear anything from [[VAT]]
- transaction tax
	- every transaction involves this tax
	- although most transactions are not affected by this tax
- turnover tax
	- since value added is mostly similar to turnover (especially production companies) the turnover "is taxed" according to [[VAT]]
- neutrality of VAT
	- whatever and whoever buys the good is taxed equally
	- beggars equally as millionaires
	- luxury yacht equally as 60 cent chewing gum 
- tax on value added
	- [[VAT]] is deducted by purchase value
	- [[VAT]] is added by sale value
	- only difference is actually taxed
# Legal Stuff
## Definition
- supply of good Art 14 et seq
- supply of service Art 24 et seq
- by a taxable person/company Art 9 et seq
- as part of economic activity
- "place of supply" (i.e. within EU) Art 31 et seq
- for consideration Art 72 et seq
## VAT is chargeable?
- who? ([[#Taxable Person]])
- what? ([[#Taxable Transactions]])
- where? ([[#Place of Supply]])
- when and how?
- how much?
- exemptions
- liability
- deductions
- administrative obligations
- special schemes
### Taxable Person
- any person
- who carries out independently (e.g. not employee of company)
- in any place
- any economic activity
- whatever the purpose
- whatever the result of that activity (i.e. does not have to produce any profit)
### Taxable Transactions
- supply of goods
	- gas, water, electricity is also a good 
- supply of service
- intra-community acquisition of goods
- import of goods (from outside of EU to [[Internal Market]])
### Place of Supply
- place (goods) ... wherever the goods are physically when the transport begins
	- main rule, many exceptions (e.g. [[#Intra-Community Acquisition]])
- place (services B2C) ... wherever the permanent establishment of the supplying company is located 
	- B2B has place of establishment of recipient
	- B2B regarding immovable property has place of property
	- B2B regarding transportation of persons has place of departure
	- B2C regarding broadcasting service has place of customer
	- B2B regarding broadcasting services has place of recipient
		- note on advertising industry:
			- value of advertisement "is created" by someone being shown the ad -> not taxed anyhow, because no cash is flowing
			- taxed transaction is only between provider (e.g. google) and customer (e.g. pizza restaurant) as normal B2B transaction
			- "value creation" is never an issue, since then VAT would be impossible to administer
#### Exception Online Shopping
- regarding online shopping, mail order company, tele-shopping or any other business which ships goods to the customer (distance sale)
	- distance sale can also be from within outside of EU
- this enabled [[VAT Shopping]]
	- all online retailers were registered in [[Luxemburg]], since it hat only 15% VAT, to only charge 15% VAT in entire EU
- remedied by the rule, that for these businesses the VAT of the recipient country need to be payed (transport of goods ends, not begins)
#### VAT One-Stop-Shop
- allows to declare all VAT charges in entire EU in a single place which simplifies the whole system dramatically
- dealing with just 1 system instead of 27 individual tax administrations
#### Intra-Community Acquisition
- place ... place where transport ends
- deduction of VAT for recipient is the same as the VAT rate charged in the transport
	- prohibits double taxation
- this results in importing countries (e.g. [[Netherlands]] with the Rotterdam port) the import country gets an unfair share of the VAT, if importing country has higher VAT rate than country of recipient 
## Collection of VAT
- VAT is collected by the business selling to the customer
- output VAT is then payed to tax authorities
- input VAT is payed to the company
- input VAT and output VAT cancels out as much as possible
	- in some cases only very little VAT to actually change hands between tax authority and business
### Exception Reverse-Charge
- no cash VAT collection by supplier - recipient of supply pays net VAT due (i.e. after deduction of input VAT) over to tax authorities
- when input VAT can be fully deducted it is a cash neutral system
- used mostly within cross-border supply of services
	- if supplier is not established in the member state of supply
	- for B2B domestic recipient is a company as well
## Tax Rates
- harmonized across EU
- one standard rate within a member state - not less than 15%
- up to 2 reduced rates - not less than 5% (Annex 3)
	- example Austria:
		- 20% standard rate
		- 10% reduced rate
			- food, books, passenger transport, medicine, rental income for residential purposes
		- 13% reduced rate
			- artists, music performances, museums, theaters, cinemas, sports events
	- for very specific products (e.g. food, books) it is possible to go below 5%
		- in total up to 5 possible rates: 1 standard, 2 reduced, 2 super-reduced
- reduced rates are controversial
	- most suppliers charge the same price as if it was taxed with 20% and just keep the delta for themselves
	- tax deduction is not passed on to consumer, which would be the idea
## Exemptions

## Exemptions
### Exemptions (Art 131 et seq)
