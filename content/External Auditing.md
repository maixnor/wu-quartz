- [[The Big 4]] vs [[Second Tier Auditors]]
- [[Professional Skepticism]]
	- about finding mistakes, not fraudulent/criminal behavior
- group management report ... Lagebericht
- KAM ... Key Audit Matters
	- matters which are of most significant during report
- reasonable vs limited assurance
	- [[sustainability report]] ... limited assurance
	- limited ... we don't know of any material misstatement
- [[IAASB]]
- Audit Opinion
	- unqualified -> always preferred
		- in EU qualified opinions are very uncommon
		- in USA qualified opinions are more common
	- qualified -> ringing alarm bells
	- disclaimer of opinion (not giving any opinion)
	- adverse (gross misstatement) -> all over the news
- very high workload during change of year (1st of December until 31st of January)
- event is recognized after 31st of December but before finalization of report
	- if cause is before 31st -> include in report
	- if cause is after 31st -> next years report
	- if effect is material -> "subsequent events" included anyways
