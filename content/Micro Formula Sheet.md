- $S$ and $D$ ... Supply and Demand
- $R$ and $C$ ... Revenue and Costs
	- $FC$ ... fixed costs
- $Q_{x}$ ... Quantity of x
- $P_{x}$ ... Price of x
- $E_{x} = \epsilon_{x}$ ... Elasticity of x
- $X^{*}$ ... Optimum/Equilibrium of X (Price, Quantity)
	- sometimes used as $X^{*}_{1}$ and $X^{*}_{2}$ #todo check
- $X^{**}$ ... another Optimum of X
	- e.g. when comparing competition vs monopoly 
- $\pi_{x}$ ... Profit of x
- $MX$ ... Marginal X (Revenue/Costs/Profit)
	- [[Marginal Changes]]
- $AX$ ... Average X (Costs, Variable Costs, Revenue)
- $X_{T}$ ... total X (costs, revenues)
# Basics
> [!important]
> I use capital letters for results, lowercase letters for inputs.
> When calculating the equilibrium quantity I use $Q^{*}$
> When calculating the profit at a quantity I use $\pi(q)$
- Equilibrium: $S = D$
- Elasticity: $\epsilon = E_{P} = \frac{\partial q / q}{\partial p / p} = \frac{\% \partial q}{\% \partial p}$
	- [[Marginal Changes]] and [[Derivatives#Elasticity|Elasticity]]
- $\pi(q) = R(q) - C(q)$
# Perfect Competition
- Maximization:
	- $\pi' = 0 \Rightarrow MR = MC$
	- $\pi'' < 0$
	- $P = AR = AC = MR = MC$
	- at $Q^{*}$: $MR = MC$
- Profit: $\pi = (P - AC) * Q$
- Supply: $MC \geq AVC$ 
	- fixed costs included
- long run: $P = MC > AC$ ... more competitors enter market, price falls until $P = AC$ and $\pi = 0$
# Monopoly
## Third Degree Price Discrimination
- $\pi(q) = p_{1}q_{1} + p_{2}q_{2} + \dots + p_{n}q_{n} - C(q_{T})$
- $MR_{1} = MR_{2} = \dots = MR_{n}$
## Two-Part Tariffs
- $P^{*} > MC$ ... buy-in price
- $T*$ ... consumer surplus of the consumer group with smaller demand $D$
- $\pi = N*T^{*} + (P^{*} - MC)(Q_{1} + Q_{2} + \dots + Q_{n}) - FC$
	- $N$ ... amount of customers in all groups, $n$ ... amount of consumer groups
