# Pricing with Market Power
- given: monopoly which has market power 
	- market power -> ability to influence price
## Conditions for Price Discrimination
- monopoly
- knowledge of individual reservation prices
- possibility of enforcing individual prices
- prevention of reselling (arbitrage)
	- e.g. [[Procter Gambel Case|Brazil Diapers]]
	- e.g. arbitrage sports betting
	- if arbitrage reselling cannot be mitigated no price setting is possible
## How to Decide
### Inputs
- market power -> monopoly
- limits of market power (consumer behavior)
### Optional Firm Behavior
#### Discrimination (multiple markets, 1 product)
- [[Price Discrimination]]
##### Example 3rd degree discrimination
$$P_{NY} = 240 - 4Q_{NY}, P_{LA} = 200 - 2Q_{LA}$$
$$MC = 40$$
#todo type this out
#todo where does the 2 come from? from differentiating the Q^2 of marginal revenue

only 1 price for all markets:
- take MR function in which all markets are willing to pay
- set MR = MC
- get combined Q* -> then get combined p*
	- p* should be between p_1* and p_2*
#### Two-Part Tariffs
- [[Two-Part Tariffs]]
#### Combinations (1 market, multiple products)
- separate pricing
	- different prices in different markets
- pre-bundling + [[Tying]]
- mixed bundling
## Large Example at the End
- independent goods $\epsilon_{1,2} = 0$
	- relative markup is the inverse of the other product
	- product with higher elasticity has lower price
- complements $\epsilon_{1,2} < 0$
	- monopolist will charge a price lower than in case with independent goods
- substitutes $\epsilon_{1,2} > 0$
	- monopolist will charge a higher price than in case with independent goods
	- otherwise there would be flocking behavior
		- make the customer choose, not just downright prefer 1
