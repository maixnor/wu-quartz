Source of Capital / Kind of Capital
- Internal, Self-Financing: [[Depreciation#Stone to Gold]], Sales of Assets, Retention of Profit
- Internal, Debt Financing: [[Provisions]]
- External, Self-Financing: [[Equity]], [[Share Capital]]
- External, Debt Financeing: [[Debt Financing]]

### It Depends
- Crowd Sourcing
	- diversify your profits -> Slaughterhouse of Southern Burgenland
		- profits were paid out in meat and sausages produced by the slaughterhouse, not in Euros

## Critical Thinking
