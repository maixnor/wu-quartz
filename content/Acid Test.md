also called "Quick Ratio" or "Quick Test"

$$\text{acid score} = \frac{\text{current assets} - \text{inventory}}{\text{current liablities}}$$
... should be as close to 1, but not under

if acid score is close to 1 then...
- short term assets are covered by short term liabilities
- long term assets are covered by long term liabilities
- otherwise you are in big trouble
	- below 1 ... very bad
	- the farther away from 1 the worse
