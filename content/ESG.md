# Why?
- a standardized auditors opinion would be very helpful
- who is this for?
	- society -> society wants to know who is damaging the environment or at least is not helping
	- investors -> moral reasons and assessing impact of climate change for future
		- e.g. will your production plant suffer from flooding?
		- e.g. do your workers in Bangladesh have good working conditions?
- most suppliers of companies have no clue about emissions -> challenging, now required
- more difficult for inherently not green industries (e.g. oil and gas)
