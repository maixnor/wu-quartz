# Overview
- [[NFRD]] with [[NaDiVeG]] (past)

	- [[CSRD]] is just saying: "you have to comply with [[ESRS]]"
	- transposition in Austria: NaBeG (pending)
- [[CSDDD]] -> EU parlament 23rd of April 2024
	- not yet transposed in Austria

- [[GRI]] -> Global Reporting Initiative
	- for voluntary use
	- now collaborating with [[IAASB]]
- [[SDGs]]
- [[SFDR]]
- [[EU Taxonomy Regulation]]
- ISSB Standards -> [[IAASB]] and [[IAS]]

# Why?
- a standardized auditors opinion would be very helpful
- who is this for?
	- society -> society wants to know who is damaging the environment or at least is not helping 
	- investors -> moral reasons and assessing impact of climate change for future
		- e.g. will your production plant suffer from flooding?
		- e.g. do your workers in Bangladesh have good working conditions?
- most suppliers of companies have no clue about emissions -> challenging, now required
- more difficult for inherently not green industries (e.g. oil and gas)
