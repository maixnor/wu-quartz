Used to raise [[Debt Capital]] (instead of loaning money from banks)

Loans issued by governments or large corporations

The interest on a bond is 1:1 what the company pays for [[Debt Capital]]. There is no bank in between which charges extra fees. It get's directly transformed to you.
### Interest Rate

Should the [[Interest Rates]] rise, the prices of bonds are generally falling. Less people will be interested in them and therefore the bond loses in value.

example:
- bond was at price 100 when purchasing and has 10% interest rate yielding 110
$$\frac{110 - 100}{100} = 10\%$$
- but if the bond rises in price to let's say 110 by market power the interest of your investment is 0%.
$$\frac{110 - 110}{110} = 0\%$$
- this does not happen because the interest is "gone" but because the interest is overshadowed by the price increase
