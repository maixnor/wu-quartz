# Future Encounters
- [[Specializations]]: Business Mathematics
	- linear algebra and analysis
	- probability
	- statistics
	- computing
- [[Specializations]]: Business Analytics 2
	- handle, visualize and summarize big data files in R
	- formulate and test hypotheses, and interpret their results in a business context
	- design, apply, and validate appropriate regression models to given real-world data sets
- in all the math-heavy courses a lot of [[Linear Regression]] is used
- bachelor thesis with institute for statistics and mathematics
	- also with non-strict mathematical thesis
	- big plus if thesis is data-heavy for ML or data analysis tasks
