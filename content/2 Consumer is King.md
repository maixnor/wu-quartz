# Consumer Behavior
## How Consumers Decide
### Consumer Preferences
- assumptions about preferences
	- complete -> consumer can compare options
	- transitivity: A > B and B > C -> A > C
	- non-satiation: more is better
		- if satiation is possible -> indifference curve is circular -> has an optimum within finite space
	- convexity -> preference for variety -> [[Common Properties of Functions#Monotonicity]]
	- continuity -> [[Marginal Changes]]

### Budget Constraint
- income -> cannot spend more than you earn

### Consumer Choice
- [[#Utility Function]] captures preferences 
	- translating the sloppy terms "nice", "bad", etc into numbers -> easier to calculate
- Consumer wants to maximize [[#Utility Function]] under the Budget Constraint

### Consumption Bundle
- 2 resources
- each bundle is represented by x and y coordinates of each resource
- some bundles are unobtainable -> outside budget constraint

### Utility Function
- assigns value "Utility" based on x and y coordinates of a bundle
- ![[FM_Utility Function.png]]
- $q_1$, $q_2$ ... x/y coordinates of bundle
- $U$ ... Utility of bundle

### Indifference Curves
![[FM_indifference curves.png]]
- bundles which are "equal" -> same utility
- preferred bundles -> more of $q_1$ or $q_2$ or both increases utility -> farther from origin
- worse bundles -> less of $q_1$ or $q2$ or both decreases utility -> closer to origin
- no indifference curves intersect -> transitivity

### Convexity
- preference of variety
- ![[FM_convexity.png]]
- combining A and B to produce optimal point C
- Concavity -> mixture of A and B would result in a lower utility than A or B -> against convexity principle
- slope of indifference curve is the relative value of the good -> [[Marginal Changes]]
	- called here; Marginal Rate of Substitution

### Marginal Utility
![[FM_marginal utility.png]]
### Curvature of Indifference Curves
![[FM_utility function curvature.png]]
- substitutes -> one can substitute the other
- complements -> one cannot substitute the other
- perfect, could not be more extreme

## Why does this cost money tho?
### Budget Constraint
- Income limits the possible bundles
- changes in income shift the limit outwards/inwards
- changing the prices is about moving the intersect of that axis
- ![[FM_income constraint.png]]

### Indifference Curve and Utility
- taking any indifference curve and finding the 2 intersections of the budget constraint
- the region between indifference and budget curve yield higher utility and are obtainable
- drawing another function through one point within this region
- repeat finding the intersects
- repeat drawing a curve through region between 2 curves
- after $n$ iterations one will reach a tangent point which has maximized the utility
- ![[FM_budget constraint.png]]

### Slopes at Points
- C: slope of utility function > slope of budget line -> move to left
- B: slope of utility function < slope of budget line -> move to right
- A: slope of utility function = slope of budget line -> stay where you are

### Boundary Solutions
- highest utility is at one of the boundaries
- absolute dominance of one product over the other
![[FM_boundary solutions.png]]

### Playing with the numbers
- higher price -> less quantity
- at each price map the distribution of products
- purple line left: continuous price-consumption curve -> how the consumption changes when costs increase/decrease
- purple line right: continuous income-consumption curve -> how the consumption changes when the overall income changes
- demand curve: capturing preference of individual, not specific actions
![[FM_changes in demand.png]]

### Engel Curve
- Demand by Income
- again, just preferences of individual
- slope and monotonicity of Engel curve (lower respectivel) is important
	- rising -> normal good (cars)
	- falling -> inferior good (hand-made brooms)
	- non -> quasilinear -> demand does not change when income changes
- ![[FM_engel curve.png]]

### Deriving Individual demand function
- [[Optimization#Lagrange Multiplier Method]] 

## Sum it all Up -> Market Demand
- each individual has different preferences
- summing up all individual preferences creates demand
	- horizontal summation
- 0 + 5 + 8 = 13
- ![[FM_market demand.png]]

### Substitution and Income Effects
- Substitution Effect -> changes in market demand regarding relative price changes
- Income Effect -> changes in market demand regarding non-relative price changes (or income changes)  
- Substitution Effect -> changing the price relatively -> demand will increase/decrease
- Income Effect -> changing the price absolutely -> income changes relatively -> demand will increase/decrease 

### Giffen Paradox
- a good affected by this phenomenon is called a [[Giffen Good]]
- a good becomes cheaper -> increased demand
- relative income increases
- increased relative income -> negative effect in demand
- negative effect in demand > increased demand due to cheaper prices
