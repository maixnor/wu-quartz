- build an MVP
	- first thing to sell, get cash quickly
	- early adopters -> loyal customers
	- not just with new companies but also with features/products
- fail fast
	- failing should be encouraged, even celebrated
	- explore many ideas instead of just one
- test it with people
	- learn, build measure
	- work with customers, not for customers
	- get feedback quickly, iterate -> [[Agile Development]]
- if it fails -> Pivot
	- realizing that the idea is good, but changing a key attribute like the customer base is a make or break decision
