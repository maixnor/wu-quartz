## Nash Equilibria Normal Form
![[ne_experiment_17.png]]
- 2 opposite NE
	- both opera or both football
- best as long as both choose the same, no incentive to deviate
## Comparison with previous Games
- chance is here not necessary to produce a positive output
	- both have a subgame strategy of going to the own venue (top right)
	- collusion can only happen when 1 - and only 1 - player is deviating from their subgame strategy to increase the payoffs

## Analysis Problems and Long-Term Thinking
- analysis
	- nothing interesting, perfect 50/50 split as if picked randomly
- long-term marriage
	- one can think of colluding to always go to either venue together (both opera or both football) which will leave one of the players with a higher payoff
	- in reality there will be some arrangement of alternating the venue either each time or occasionally to create equal payoffs for both partners
