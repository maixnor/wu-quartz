## Nash Equilibria Normal Form
![[exp_18_normal_form.png]]
- 2 opposite NE with incentive to deviate
	- 1 stay, 2 steer
	- 1 steer, 2 stay
- I can only gain what you loose (opportunity cost)

## Difference to Prisoners Dilemma
- PD has just 1 clear NE in normal form and 1 better NE if collusion is possible
	- as long as I don't deviate, there is no chance of being hurt by other player
- this game has 2 NE where the activity of either player is always hurting the other player through opportunity cost 
	- risk of a crash which hurts both players considerably

## Commitment and Comparison to 5
- commitment ... would be something like being crazy in experiment 5
	- strategic move of removing the steering wheel
		- player is now unable to steer away such that the other player is forced to steer to avoid certain destruction
	- similar to the doomsday machine which we also watched a video on
