> Discrimination ... charging different customers different amounts

# Degrees
## 1st degree: individual prices
- charging each customer the maximum they are willing to pay
- perfect requires the ability to distinguish the maximum ability to pay -> very hard
	- lower prices the longer in cart does not work -> customer can pretend to be low willingness to pay and then wait for the price reduction
	- easier with large information density of customers (e.g. Amazon)
- imperfect is more doable
	- e.g. doctors, accountants can partially figure out the customers willingness to pay 
## 2nd degree: non-linear pricing 
- depending on when and how much you buy there are different prices
	- customer base is cut into blocks, each block has maximum price
- surge pricing, [[#Peak Load Pricing]] as well
	- also includes [[Economy of Scale]] -> higher volume, lower price
- e.g. electricity price (normally not consumer price, but actual grid price)
- e.g. 20 GB data included, after that each GB costs 5$ 
	- not every unit sold (consumed) is priced equally
- e.g. flight tickets -> tickets at Christmas are more expensive
## 3rd degree: group prices
- different groups of customers pay different price
- e.g. lower prices for students, seniors
- e.g. private vs business clients
- e.g. branded vs no-name products
	- also includes non-real product differences
- e.g. more expensive drinks around 24:00 -> highest demand then
- e.g. selling for different amounts in different countries (before transport costs, tax, etc)
### Algebra
- within all price regions the Marginal Revenue will equal the Marginal Cost since we can adjust the quantity sold in all markets/groups
	- all groups are linked by the same production costs
	- $MR_1 = MR_2 = MC$
	- otherwise not maximized profits
- rule of thumb: 
$$MR_1 = p(1 + \frac{1}{\epsilon_{D_i}})$$
$$MR_1 = MR_2$$
$$\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \frac{(1 + \frac{1}{\epsilon_{D_2}})}{(1 + \frac{1}{\epsilon_{D_2}})}$$

# Methods
## Inter-Temporal
- distinguish willingness to pay by time of purchase
	- impatient consumers pay more
- e.g. devices become cheaper after some team
	- highest price right after launch
## Peak Load Pricing
- different prices at different times
- on-peak vs off-peak prices
- e.g. Uber is more expensive at peak times
- e.g. flight tickets more expensive around Christmas
