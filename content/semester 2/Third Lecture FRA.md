### Cash Flow Statement
- cash flow has direct and indirect method
	- direct: looking at THE bank account (if there is one) and adding up all transactions
	- indirect: P/L Statement result (EBIT normally) + [[Non-Cash Transactions]] in reverse
- definition capitalization: anything we put on the asset side
- operating cash flow generally (indirect method):
	- EBIT
	- + depr
	- +/- $\Delta$ working capital i.e. current assets (excluding cash) - current liabilities
- investment cash flow generally (direct method):
	- - cash outflow (investing)
	- + cash inflow (disinvesting)
	- !!! only $\Delta$ of how much I paid and got back later, dividends not included (part of net profit, therefore already in operating cashflow)
- finance cash flow generally (direct method):
	- - cash outflow (paying back loan)
	- + cash inflow (taking out loan)
- free cash flow 
	- "The key metric to judge the success of a firm" - CEO of Siemens
	- equivalent to [[disposable income]] in [[Personal Finance]]
	- operating CF + investment CF
	- used for buying subsidiaries other long-term investments
- cash equivalents -> can be liquidated within 3 months
- net change in cash = operating CF + investment CF + finance CF
- income tax comes after cash flow calculations but is a cash outflow
	- income tax is separately with cash outflow
	- directly reported -> extra line within cash flow calculations
- operating CF must be positive -> ultimate goal is **not** profit, but positive cash flow
- re-invest at minimum amount of depreciation -> keep up production
- ![[AG & Co. KGaA]]
- selling of inventory in P/L
	- - cost of goods sold
	- + income of sales
	- = profit (hopefully)
- inventory can only be written down, never up
- sale of non-current asset
	- cash-inflow -> + invensting CF
	- gain/loss (sale price - book value)
		- EBT +/-
		- non-cash -> operating CF -/+

### Provisions
- [[Provisions]]
### Intangible Assets
- must be identifiable
- indefinite/definite useful life span
	- yearly impairment check to indefinite assets -> write down
- initially measured at cost (purchase or production cost)
#### Research and Development
- research is never capitalized -> never on balance sheet, pure expense
- development **must** be capitalized under [[IFRS]] -> on balance sheet
	- requirements: technical feasibility, intention and ability to use/sell
- development **must never** be capitalized under AT and DE laws
### Goodwill
- brand names
	- only acquired brand names may be capitalized
		- e.g. Adidas may not capitalize on Adidas brand, but on Reebok brand, which they bought
- patents
	- acquired: capitalize costs
	- internal: capitalize if identifiable costs
- in general everything which contributes to earnings but is not in balance sheet
	- Reputation
	- HR & Culture
	- Connections and Contracts
- Goodwill can be a large part of deals (e.g. 80% of Instagrams price when bought by Meta was goodwill)
	- future integration and synergy mostly for the reason
- under IFRS Goodwill is never depreciated
	- under local law you would have to
	- but there is an annual impairment test for [[Cash Generating Unit]] 
		- one company you buy can consist of multiple [[Cash Generating Unit]]
#### How to get
- given buying a whole company (not on stock market)
- the fair value is bought at purchase price (fair value + goodwill)
- purchase price: 300
	- fair value of assets: 200
	- amazing engineers employed: 100 <- this is the goodwill
## Taxation
### Value Added Tax
- [[VAT]] (Mehrwertssteuer)
- flow through (almost never in [[Profit and Loss Statement]])
### Income Tax
- Group Effective Tax Rate
	- Group with all subsidiaries buy an aggregate amount of income tax
- pure Income Tax 
- communal Income Tax
- etc -> anything which taxes profits
#### Tax Base
- tax base -> what value is the total tax derived from
	- universally: profit - tax-deductions
- in continental Europe the deductions are quite few
- in anglosaxon system the deductions are quite numerous
#### Current vs Deferred Tax
- current: needs to be payed right now
- deferred: taxes which will probably occur in the future
	- almost like a provision, but with taxes (also on asset side)
	- [[tax loss carry-forward]]
		- if I have a loss this year then next year I have to pay less
		- if that is certain I can book it as an asset
#### Tax Reconciliation Statement
- if the whole worldwide income was subject to local taxation
	- because local income is subject to local tax
### Taxable Profit
- definition of taxable profit is not the exact tax base
	- almost all countries have amendments (each country has different rules)
- A sort of [[Cash Flow#Indirect Method]]
	- Accounting Profit before Tax
		- individual statement -> taxation happens on legal entity
	- + Disallowed Expenses
		- Excess Depreciation
			- Impairment, Write-downs (e.g. write-down for bad debt), other estimates
		- Excess Provision
		- Fines
		- Hospitality
			- going on a nice dinner/lunch with your customers, buying concert tickets
	- - Special Allowances
		- Capital Investment, etc
			- e.g. dividend income -> avoid double taxation
			- not a benefit, just a basic principle to keep the system going
	- - Non-Taxable Income
		- not allowed to deduct from accounting profit, but from taxable income
	- Calculate tax by statutory tax rate (Austria 23%)
	- = Current Tax Expense of Year XXXX
		- feeds back into income statement (P/L)
		- EBIT - Income Tax + [[Deferred Tax]]
		- = Net Profit "After Tax"
	- Effective Tax Rate
		- income tax / EBT
		- ETR != Statutory Tax Rate
		- Why is there a difference? -> [[Tax Reconciliation Statement]]
