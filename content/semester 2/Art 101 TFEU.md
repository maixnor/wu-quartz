# Article 101 TFEU - Anti-Competitive agreements
- 2 **or** more undertakings
- agreement, decision or concerted practice
	- written or oral agreement -> although not necessarily a contract
	- gentlemen's agreement included
	- general practice included
	- decision by a [[Trade Association]]
		- Association does not have money, going after member companies therefore
	- concerted practices 
		- parallel behavior hard to distinguish from cooperation
		- burden of proof lies with enforcers (authorities)
		- 3 criteria
			- concerting with each other
			- subsequent conduct on the market
			- cause & effect
		- example: gas station prices
	- horizontal vs vertical agreement
		- horizontal ... refinery cooperating with other refineries
		- vertical ... refinery cooperating with gas stations
			- if in a conglomerate it is okay from anti-competitive
			- but dominant position laws within 102 come into effect 
- appreciable effect on trade between member states
	- EU Laws should only be applied to EU relevant cases 
	- para 52: thresholds ([[NAAT Rule]])
		- market share not above 5%
		- aggregate (horizontal) or suppliers (vertical) annual turnover not above 40 Million EUR
	- para 53: rebuttable positive presumption
		- imports/exports or covers several member states
		- + turnover threshold exceeded
	- **also applies to hardcore restraints**
- appreciable effect on competition
	- effect must be "noticeable" to be illegal
	- agreement does not have to be on EU scale, even if effect is 
	- [[De Minis Notice]]
		- para 2: not applicable if agreement has the object of restricting competition
		- threshold
			- 10% aggregate for competitors (horizontal)
			- 15% each for non-competitors (vertical)
			- 5% in case of network effect
	- consequence: justification under Article 101(3) TFEU highly unlikely
- object or effect of preventing, restricting or distorting competition
	- "restriction of competition"
	- Article 101(1) TFEU -> long **non-exhaustive** list of behaviors
##  Exceptions to Article 101 TFEU
- 4 cumulative conditions
	- 2 positive conditions
		- Improvement -> Innovation
		- passing on to consumer -> [[Principle of Consumer Wealth]]
	- 2 negative conditions
		- no indispensable restrictions -> everything is necessary
		- no enabling to eliminate competition -> competition is still functioning
## Block Exemptions
- the [[VABER]] 2022/720
- [[Distribution Agreements]] -> vertical agreements
- does not apply to huge companies
- first thing when setting up distribution agreements is to be [[VABER]] compliant 
	- ensures safety from anti-competition claims
## Consequences of Infringement
- those parts of the agreement are **void** (not the whole agreement)
- fines of up to 10% of previous years turnover (public enforcement)
	- highest fine was 4.3 Billion EUR
	- Austria only: Authority may keep parts of the fine -> incentive
- damages actions by other companies or consumers are possible
- loss of reputation, bad publicity, loss of share value
