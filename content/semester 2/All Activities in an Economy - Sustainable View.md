- SH ... significant harm
- SC ... substantial substitution

### No technical improvement
- e.g. Cement (at least after new non-baking process is rolled out extensively)

### Already covered by [[EU Taxonomy Regulation]]
- not problematic, covered very well

### Included in Future
- currently hard to report on, since list of [[EU Taxonomy Regulation]] aligned activities is exhaustive

### Little Impact
- mostly not covered
- e.g. consulting company has little to report on, coffee consumption in the office is not a big concern :)
