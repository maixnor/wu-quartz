# Rules and Setup
- 2 players offering, 1 player accepting
	- simultaneous (offers at the same time) and sequential (accepting after both offers)

# Compare To
- #todo gt1 5 47
- what is your opportunity cost?
	- if buying a car: think about what the agent will earn during the sale
	- if there is just 1 buyer - you - your bargaining power is much higher
	- if there are many buyers your bargaining power is lower

# Equilibria
- A and B should offer as much as possible -> don't know what other player is offering
	- if offer of other player was known just 1-upping other player would be best
- C accepts higher offer, if both offers are the same -> chose any
- solved again via Backwards Induction
- SPNE: (A: MC, B: MC, C: a>b: a; a<b: b, a=b: a or b)
	- MC ... marginal cost
