- [[2 Consumer is King|last lecture]] was consumer taking care of needs / consumer behavior
	- demand given
- this lecture is suppliers and how they take actions and decisions
	- supply (price) given / perfect competition analysis
- related to: [[Competition]]
# 3 Steps
- revenue expectations
	- demand
	- competition -> lower prices
- cost constraints
	- technology -> different combinations of inputs produce same output
	- efficiency -> choosing least cost to produce same output
	- input cost -> revenue must be higher than production cost -> profit
- output choices
	- what to do with profits?
## Production Technology
- production function
	- shows highest output possible (not efficiently)
	- maps the equilibrium prices of inputs and outputs
	- $Q = F(K, L)$ output = F( capital , labor )
		- [[Marginal Changes]] in Labor and Capital interesting
### Short Term Production 
- short term != short term -> depends on business
- Production with one variable input
	- certain inputs cannot be adjusted fast e.g. expert machinery
	- Law of [[Diminishing Marginal Returns]]
### Long Term Production
- all production inputs can be adjusted -> multi-variable
- Production with two variable input
	- different combinations of capital and labor can yield same output -> [[Substitution]]
	- [[Isoquant]] -> all combinations of input which yield the same output 
	- Marginal Rate of Technical Sustitution
		- MRTS -> [[Diminishing Marginal Returns]] for each Isoquant
		- how much can capital substitute labor and vice versa
	- special case: inputs are perfect substitutes
		- Isoquants are linear -> any combination of capital and labor feasible
	- special case: inputs cannot be substituted
		- Isoquants are L shaped -> precise mapping of capital and labor
### Returns to Scale
- scaling inputs and outputs equally -> both 2x
- how much is the output going to change -> 1x? 1.5x? 2x? 3x? 10x?
	- 2x -> constant returns to scale
	- <2x -> decreasing returns to scale
	- >2x -> increasing returns to scale
- if returns to scale is 
	- increasing then a monopoly is beneficial for society
	- decreasing then a split into many small companies is beneficial for society
- $F(L,K) = A*L^{\alpha}*K^{\beta}$
- scaling by factor $\lambda > 1$ : $F(\lambda L, \lambda K) = \lambda^{\alpha + \beta} * F(L,K)$
	- [[Cobb-Douglas]] production function
## Production Costs
- cost function
	- cost minimization for given
	- linear (simple models) or convex ($x^2$)
- $C = w * L +  r * K$ 
	- Cost = wages * labor + rent rate * capital
- economic cost != accounting cost
	- economic cost -> cost of utilizing resources in production
	- [[Opportunity Cost]] very relevant
	- [[Past Sunk Cost]] irrelevant -> not human-like behavior
- fixed costs vs variable costs
	- marginal costs -> how much one more unit in output will cost
	- average costs -> amount produced / total cost
### Short Term
- capital and output level is fixed
	- calculating labor level which satisfies the desired output level
- no substitution whatsoever
- marginal cost vs marginal product of labor
### Long Term
- capital can be adjusted too
	- capital / labor combination can be chosen at will
- [[Isocost]] -> all combinations of capital and labor
	-  constant function $-\frac{w}{r}$
- Isocost function and Isoquant function have to intersect
	- lowest cost until Isocost is tangent to Isoquant curve
	- $-\frac{w}{r} = MRTS = + \frac{MP_L}{MP_K}$
	- $\frac{MP_L}{w} = \frac{MP_K}{r}$
- change in Input Cost (wage $w$ or rent rate $r$)
	- tangent line changes slope and therefore intersection point
	- e.g. wages rise -> hire less workers -> substitute with more capital
### Expansion
- short term -> only labor can be increased (faster but higher Isocost)
- long term -> scaling labor and capital equally (least Isocost -> more efficient)
- for different quantities drawing different cost functions
	- envelope of functions are linear if returns to scale constant
- choosing output amount -> calculating best cost function -> calculating best capital / labor combination
## Maximum Profit
- choosing optimal output amount
- Marginal Revenue = Marginal Costs
	- function is always concave
- what if maximum profit is negative?
	- shut the company down -> 0$ profit > negative profit
	- long term: $p \geq AC(q)$ ... price needs to be larger than average cost of quantity
	- short term: $p \geq AVC(q)$ ... price needs to be larger than average variable cost of quantity
## Market Supply
### Short Term
- just summing up all individual supply functions
