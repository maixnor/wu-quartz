- givens
	- 2 prisoners in separate cells - no communication is possible
	- if both prisoners do not confess -> both 2 years
	- if both prisoners confess -> both 5 years
	- if one prisoner confesses -> confessing 0 years, other 10 years
- the dilemma
	- in a perfect world (social optimum) it would be best for both prisoners to not confess
		- social optimum ... sum of all payoffs
		- result both 2 years
	- in reality it is for both prisoners the dominant strategy to confess
		- -5 > -10 and 0 > -2
		- result both 5 years
- result
	- no [[Nash Equilibrium]] since the optimum (both not confessing) cannot be reached
	- both players have dominant strategy of confessing -> both will confess
