# Standard Error
- different samples from same population are slightly different
	- calculate variance of sample means
- sample mean $\bar{x}$ is a good estimator of population mean $\mu$
$$E[\bar{x}_n] = E[\frac{1}{n}\sum^n_{i = 1} x_i] = \frac{1}{n}\sum^n_{i = 1} E[x_i] = \mu$$
 $$\mu = \frac{1}{n} * n * \mu = E[\bar{x}_n]$$
- SE is standard deviation of $\bar{x}$
	- calculate variance of $\bar{x}_n$
