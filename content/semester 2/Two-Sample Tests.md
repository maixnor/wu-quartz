# Inference Based on Two Samples
- 2 samples needed
	- comparison between these 2 samples
	- e.g. control group vs medicated group in medical trials
- $\mu_{1} - \mu_{2}$ ... difference between means
- $\sigma_{1}$ and $\sigma_{2}$ for deviations
## Large Samples
- $z = \frac{(\bar{x}_{1} - \bar{x}_{2}) - d_{0}}{\sigma_{\bar{x}_{1} - \bar{x}_{2}}}$ 
- with $z = \sigma_{\bar{x}_{1} - \bar{x}_{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{s_{1}^{2}}{n_{1}} + \frac{s_{2}^{2}}{n_{2}}}$
- two-tailed tests: $H_{0} = \mu_{1} - \mu_{2} = d_{0}$
## Small Samples
- pooled estimator:
$$s_{p}^{2} = \frac{(n_{1} - 1)s_{1}^{2} + (n_{2} - 1)s^{2}_{2}}{n_{1}+n_{2}-2}$$
- t-statistic
$$t = \frac{(\bar{x}_{1} - \bar{x}_{2}) - d_{0}}{\sqrt{s^{2}_{p}(\frac{1}{n_{1}} + \frac{1}{n_{2}})}}$$
- two-tailed tests: $H_{0} = \mu_{1} - \mu_{2} = d_{0}$
