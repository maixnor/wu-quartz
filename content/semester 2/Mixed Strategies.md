# Requirements
- 0-sum game
- indifference condition
	- agents must be indifferent to which strategy they use
	- e.g. rock-paper-scissors
		- there is no clear profit-maximizing strategy
		- any response is the best response in pure strategies
# Equilibrium
- no [[Nash Equilibrium]] in pure strategies
- **BUT** there is an [[equilibrium]] with **mixed strategies**
	- mixed strategy ... taking probabilities of actions into account
		- i.e. preferences of other players
	- players are only willing to change their preferences "randomize" when there is otherwise no chance for profit
		- e.g. during rock-paper-scissors one might pick one option multiple times to get an edge
	- with symmetrical games they will always randomize -> always equal probabilities
	- with asymmetrical games they will only randomize when chances are equal, otherwise players have dominant strategies
