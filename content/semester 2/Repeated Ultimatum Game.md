# Setup and Rules
- same as in [[Ultimatum Game]]

# Implications of Finite Repetitions
- last round looks exactly like the [[Ultimatum Game]]
	- B should accept any offer - no future anymore
	- solution does not depend on the previous rounds
	- using [[backward induction]] we can extend that to second to last round and so forth till the first round for the 1 SPNE
	- result: never offer more than minimum, always accept any offer (the SPNE)
		- this rollback-based proof holds for any finitely repeated game
		- as soon as there are more than 1 SPNE anymore this does not hold anymore
	- also applies to [[Prisoners Dilemma]], even if it is repeated
- offers are larger than in non-repeated [[Ultimatum Game]]
