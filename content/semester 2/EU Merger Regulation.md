# Merger Regulation
- only enforced by European Commission -> nationals have no control
	- if not EU level, then nationals can act on national laws
- Merger Regulation 139/2004 ([[EU Merger Regulation]])
- Ex ante investigation -> prospective analysis, notifications of companies merging
	- only after approval of Commission is the merge legal
## Analysis under EUMR
### Jurisdiction 
- concentration
	- change of control (not necessarily ownership)
	- control ... decisive influence
		- positive control: taking decisions about company
		- negative control: hinder company from taking decisions (e.g. veto)
	- sole control vs joint control (only a handful of companies together)
		- no definite % of shares mentioned
- [[Union Dimension]]
- between EU and non EU undertakings
	- EU can block the merger from the EU side (EU company may not merge) -> therefore merger is blocked entirely
	- EU and other authorities may have conversations
		- if no agreement is found the merger is blocked by either side or both
### Substantive Analysis
- [[SIEC Test]] -> is the position dominant after a merger?
	- (i) SIEC - dominance (unilateral effects)
	- (ii) SIEC - collective dominance (coordinated effects)
	- (iii) SIEC - other than dominance (unilateral effects)
- other factors
	- degree of concentration of the relevant market
		- 3 to 2 merger not appreciated
	- level of market share held by parties
	- competitor relations
	- opportunities to switch suppliers for customers
	- development of price and product
	- assets such as data, IP rights
		- against building IP monopoly (e.g. all patents in one company then)
	- [[Research and Development]]
- horizontal vs vertical mergers -> same as with horizontal vs vertical Agreements
	- horizontal mergers: concentration measure
		- [[HHI Herfindahl Hirschmann Index]]
		- Horizontal Merger Guidelines (2004)
		- sum of all squared market shares before and after the merger
	- procedural aspects 
		- notification
		- phase I investigation
		- phase II investigation
		- [[one-stop-shop principle]] -> going **only** to the highest authority 
		- referral to commission
	- remedies
		- may not be suggested by commission
#### Telering Case (Maverick)
- Telering was bought by T Mobile
- Telering was a [[Maverick]] -> Keeping prices down so that the large players cannot increase prices excessively
