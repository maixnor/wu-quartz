# Hodgson
- norms are kind of like international law (or the other way round rather), meaning that the "legislator" is the community rather than a "court"
- "a rule is only as much a rule as it is enforced" -> reminds me of the ZDF Magazin Royal episode on Cybercrime (German) about how cybercrime in Germany is hardly if ever enforced
- some "habits" are also deeply nested within our primate roots (Robin Hanson, The Elefant in the Brain). Things like social status and dominance reach back to common ancestors with lobsters (secondary source Jordan Peterson)
# Davis

# Stilwell

# Frerichs
- this would have been great as the first point in the reading list as an introduction to delve deeper into the different topics as follow ups
