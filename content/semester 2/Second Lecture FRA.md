- clicker questions are not to be recorded, they will be reused

- Annual Financial Statements are not publicly available in China
- Assets > Short-term Investments -> bonds, shares
- Liabilities > Provisions -> rather sure that you will pay something in the future (court case)
### Notes from Clicker Questions
- constraint in financial accounting under [[IFRS]]
	- cost-benefit: #wontfix what is this?
- impairment vs write-off
	- book value of an asset is decreased through depreciation
	- a sudden and unexpected event happens -> impairment
		- impairment would be checked at end of year
	- the act of adjusting the books -> write-off
- depreciation only on non-current assets, current assets might experience impairment tho
- operating result: EBIT, not EBITDA -> [[Financial Ratios#EBIT]]
	- definitely not the operating cash flow
- profit in books does not mean positive cash flow -> they can be all receivables
# TikTok
- Sales in just US is 16 Billion USD
- [[ByteDance]]: owning company of [[TikTok]]
- [[ByteDance]] made 120 Billion in global revenue (+40% from previous year)
	- impressive increase, especially at this scale
- [[Meta]] made 135 Billion USD (only +16% from previous year)
- [[ByteDance]] declined to comment on financial data -> private company
	- publicly held = listed on stock exchange, privately held = not listed
- [[TikTok]] remains unprofitable -> huge sales, yet no profit
	- strong focus on growth -> investments lower profit
	- similar to if not purely R&D costs
	- any profit distribution does not effect profit itself
- [[China]] "firmly opposes" any forced sale of [[TikTok]]
# Some more Henkel
- CEO says company is on a good path -> obviously
- [[Financial Ratios#EBIT|EBIT]] Margin between 12% and 13.5%
- Competitor Beiersdorf did better than Henkel last year
### Earnings Call
- conference call of CEO + CFO with investors and analysts
- explaining what happened last year and what is planned for this year
	- 4.2% organic sales growth
	- battery production
	- plans to divest underperforming 350 Million EUR until end of 2024
		- underperforming ... not meeting profit margin of 12%
- free cash flow ... cash which can be used for anything -> [[Hierarchy of Financing]]
	- financing which is not bound to any agreement
	- e.g. when taking out a loan the bank wants to know what this money will be used for, your money you can used for ANYTHING
# Income Statement & Balance Sheet
- [[Profit and Loss Statement]] = [[Income Statement]], they are the same
- EBIT: operating result
- PBT: profit before tax
- (N)PAT: profit after tax
- cost of sales ... directly attributable costs + plant/equipment overhead
	- materials
	- salaries
	- depreciation
- expenses by nature -> materials, salaries, depreciation
- expenses by function -> cost of sales, marketing, R&D, etc

- [[Accrual Accounting#Example - Shoes]]

## Revenue Recognition
- [[IFRS#Revenue Recognition]]

- back to Henkel -> only when Henkel has done everything they need to do to complete a sale i.e. delivered all the goods, etc
	- just a contract is not enough
	- just hopeful thinking is not enough
- sales is often toyed with quite intensely

- if it is likely that products will be returned (e.g. due to poor quality) then the share of sales is not included in the sales figure
	- true for spikes (new production launch regarding 40% sales)
	- true for everyday business (e.g. 1.5% of products are returned)

- back to Henkel -> adjusted EBIT. What is that?
	- "adjusted" includes the restructuring during the merger of "detergents" and "care" into "consumer brands"
	- "adjusted" includes one-time costs of leaving Russia this year
	- message to investors -> why the figures are so low
	- [[Restructuring]] = firing people and external contractors

## General Notes on Revenues
- [[Trirangular Relationship]]
- how do companies calculate the operating cash flow?
	- [[Cash Flow#Indirect Method]] 
	- direct approach would mean to have a second set of books for all cash transactions
- [[Inventory]]
- [[Expenses]]
- [[Evaluation of Assets]]
- [[Assets]]
- [[Depreciation]]
- Bad Debt
	- the debt is impossible to be payed back (bankruptcy) -> this is gone -> write-down
		- trade receivable is not being payed back -> expense
	- the debt is unlikely to be payed back (e.g. customer not responding to warnings) -> re-asses receivable
		- find out what is the probability that it is not payed back
