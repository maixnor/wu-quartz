## dominant strategy
- whatever the others are doing a specific strategy is always the best
- player-specific, not all agents have to have the same dominant strategy
- always part of [[equilibrium]]
## dominated strategy
- whatever the others are doing a specific strategy will always be inferior to another strategy
- never part of [[equilibrium]]

## weakly dominant strategy
- >= than all others
- might be part of (some) [[equilibrium]]

## weakly dominated strategy
- <= than all others
- might even be part of (some) [[equilibrium]]
	- although unlikely
