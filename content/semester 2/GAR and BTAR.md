# GAR - Green Asset Ration
- percentage of bank's portfolio which is classified as sustainable
	- other financial companies
	- private households
	- local authorities
	- non-financial companies -> [[NFRD]]
		- Turnover, CAPEX, OPEX
		- limited by [[NFRD]] catchment
			- only large companies are regarded
		- lot's of small companies can be not aligned and still not show up in report
			- problem will be reduced if more companies are included in [[NFRD]] and [[CSRD]]
- forces non-financial companies to report voluntarily on most important indicators
	- affects future loan negotiations

# BTAR - Book Taxonomy Alignment Ratio
- problem: companies which are not large enough do not report currently based on [[NFRD]] or [[CSRD]]
- solution: just add the small companies to the nominator and do some sort of [[Materiality Assesment]] on them
- only a temporary solution until more companies are reporting by themselves
- banks need a lot of information of the smaller companies they invest in; issues in 2 points
	- manpower - not enough people to do the assessments
	- information - most smaller companies don't even have the information to begin with
		- e.g. which tires are your cars using?
