# Science of data
## Descriptive Statistics
- quantitative vs qualitative data
## Inferential Statistics
- predictions, estimates of sample data -> stock market
	- confidence intervals
	- hypothesis testing
	- regression analysis
# Definitions
- experimental unit -> what we collect data from
- population -> group of experimental units -> subgroup of all global data
	- e.g. all working adults in Austria
- variable -> characteristic or property in a population
- sample -> a subset of the population (not biased/selected)
	- e.g. the working adults in Austria asked by survey X
- statistical [[inference]] -> estimate, prediction, etc on population based on sample
	- e.g. the preference of cola brand based on 1.000 people survey
- measure of reliability -> statement about uncertainty
# Data 
## Which data?
- if data is qualitative or quantitative is dependent on the experiment
- cloth size can be qualitative -> (S, M, L) or quantitative -> (120 cm, 150 cm)
### Qualitative Variables
- cannot be measured in numbers
- nominal variable
	- classification -> e.g. member of religion
	- definitely true with binary data points (yes/no)
- ordinal variable
	- same like nominal variables
	- have an order
	- can be sorted, ranked
		- e.g. course grades
### Quantitative Variables
- continuous, metric variable
- interval variable
	- linear scale of values -> differences between values are meaningful
		- e.g. temperature, time
- ratio variable
	- ratio between 2 values is meaningful 
	- there must be a natural 0 
		- e.g. temperature in Celsius has no natural 0, Calvin does
## Sources
- published source
- designed experiment -> full control over all variables, artificial environment
- observational study -> data collection within natural environment
## Population vs Sample
- representative sample
	- mostly done using random samples
	- analogy with pot of soup -> could taste different in different parts of the pot
- ensuring reliability of results
## Sampling Error
- Selection Bias -> if certain subsets of a population are under/over represented within sample
- non-response bias -> not ensuring that data is collected from all experimental units
- measurement error -> just wrong values at time of analysis
