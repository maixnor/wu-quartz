# Schroeder
- 4.1 I liked. The middle ground is the best of both worlds. Like the suburbs combine the worst of both countryside and city living
- codeteremination of workers likely also induces a great public school system, since skilled workers are in demand everywhere, therefore everyone profits from better education
# Witt
- i like the approach of gradually grouping countries/economies together until in the end they are all different. Gives an opportunity to acknowledge when and by how much countries differ
- interesting to see how different parts of the world from different cultural and historical backgrounds can experience so similar growth situations, especially in developing countries
