## Payoff Matrix
- $N$ - dimensional -> $N$ ... number of players
- $m \times m$ matrix -> $m$ ... number of strategies of players
	- square if all players have same (number of) strategies
- Rock-Paper-Scissors with 2 players
	- 2-dimensional matrix. 3x3 (rock, paper, scissors are the strategies of both players)

## Sequential Payoff Matrix
- putting in full strategies, not just choices
	- [[Example Color Competition]]
- [[Experiment 5 GT1]] has a very nice payoff matrix

## Payoff vs Outcome
- payoff ... individual value
- outcome ... grouping of payoff combinations
