## Solve a Dilemma
- communication
- forming a [[cartel]]

## Examples for Dilemma
- provision of public goods
	- non-excludable: nobody can be executed
	- non-rival: one's consumption does not hurt the others
	- public transport
	- group: everybody profits if provided
	- individual: profit of freeriding
	- outcome: nobody provides, the street is not built
- common pool resources
	- fishes in a pond, each fisherman can fish as many as he wants, if too much fish is fished then the fish will die out
	- individual: I fish as much as possible, nobody else fishes anything
	- group: fish as much as possible together in long term
	- outcome: everyone wants to fish a bit more than average, therefore the fish die out

# Prisoners Dilemma Specific
- givens
	- 2 prisoners in separate cells - no communication is possible
	- if both prisoners do not confess -> both 2 years
	- if both prisoners confess -> both 5 years
	- if one prisoner confesses -> confessing 0 years, other 10 years
- the dilemma
	- in a perfect world (social optimum) it would be best for both prisoners to not confess
		- social optimum ... sum of all payoffs
		- result both 2 years
	- in reality it is for both prisoners the dominant strategy to confess
		- -5 > -10 and 0 > -2
		- result both 5 years
- result
	- no [[Nash Equilibrium]] since the optimum (both not confessing) cannot be reached
	- both players have dominant strategy of confessing -> both will confess
