- Critical Remarks:
	- tl;dr markets are emergent phenomena in groups of self-interested agents. Why did this take 10 pages? -> [[Emergent Behavior]]

- Questions: 
	- wouldn't this be so much easier to explain using [[emergent behavior]] theory like [[cellular automata]]? Then going into detail how different variables can/are changing temporaly (like iteration speed in digital markets) or culturally (more/less greed).
	- Below I've linked a nice visualization video which would also help in giving a visual part to the whole "market" phenomena, wherein a market would be represented by larger blobs of intense activity. Instead of more distant or loosely related trades [https://youtu.be/kzwT3wQWAHE?si=JoFM2uc2ClAowPRO](https://youtu.be/kzwT3wQWAHE?si=JoFM2uc2ClAowPRO)
