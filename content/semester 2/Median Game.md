- payoffs are defined by the median choice and your decision
- blue dotted box ... my choice = median choice
- sometimes deviating from the mean results in higher payoffs for me (red boxes)
- convergence to 2 equilibria (blue boxes)
- out-of-equilibrium dynamics which slowly funnel the masses to wards the equilibriums -> convergence
