### Identical Products
- compete through price rather than quantities
- oligopolistic industry
- equilibrium price depends on homogeneity of products
- applicable when changes in capacities are easy to make
#### Bertrand Paradox
- [[homogenous products]]
- one firm undercuts the others
	- takes most customers
- other firms have to adjust (or undercut others themselves)
- strong incentive to undercut everyone
- strong incentive to keep decreasing until p = MC
	- equilibrium: p = MC
- just 2 firms are enough to reach equilibrium
- shows importance of strategic variables (price vs quantity)
- is a form of [[Nash Equilibrium]]
- criticism:
	- seems unnatural for firms (gentlemen's agreement)
	- even at equal prices the firms do not share the market 50/50 necessarily
		- [[Tie Breaking Rules]] important with modelling
### Different Products
- small differences (still same market)
- each firm sets it's own price and takes price of competition as given
- oligopolistic industry
- profit maximization:
	- best price to choose
$$
P_{1}^{*}  = \frac{a + b_{2} + P_{2} + c_{1} b_{1}}{2b_{1}}
$$
	- afterwards same thing for $P_{2}^{*}$ 
	- then solve for both unknowns $P_{1}$ and $P_2$
- result:
	- when firm 2 increases prices, firm 1 should increase prices as well

- Collusion ... Cartel price setting
- related to [[Dilemma Games]]
	- it would be best (highest profit) for both companies to collude
	- but competing is always the dominant strategy
