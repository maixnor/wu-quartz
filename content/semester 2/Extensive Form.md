## Decision Tree
- 

## Information Sets
- decision nodes connected/encircled by a dotted line
- player does not know where exactly where in the set he is
	- i.e. player does not have full information on other players strategies
	- [[Example Color Competition]]
		- second player does not know what first player picked
- kind of simultaneous game
	- at least for decision making it can be viewed as simultaneous
	- therefore also a simultaneous game can be drawn as a graph
	- [[Example Rock Paper Scissors]]
		- both players do it at the same time, no information known before decision
