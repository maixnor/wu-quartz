# General
- goal is redirecting capital flows 
	- targeting banks and other investors when giving out loans
- 2 parts
	- [[SFDR]] for financial companies
	- [[NFRD]] for producing companies
- does not need to be transposed
	- in effect since 2021
- EU classifies what is green and what isn't
	- addresses [[Green Washing]] -> less approved
		- [[DWS Case]]
		- activists challenge green washing
			- rather report honest 0% alignment than fake 10%
	- any kind of [[defense industry]] is not deemed as green
		- [[defense industry]] will hopefully face higher financing costs therefore
- have to separately report on
	- Revenue
	- CAPEX
	- OPEX
- generates a percentage on how much money is used or made for/from green endeavors
	- problems: 
		- perspectives change rapidly (e.g. is nuclear energy green or not?)
		- laws are slow to change (technological advancements may be too fast)
- collecting data on all subsidiaries around the world
	- digital infrastructure
		- data collection (finding out about data points)
		- [[Digital Tagging]]

## Qualitative Reporting Requirements
- accounting method
	- how was aligned Revenue/CAPEX/OPEX determined
- double counting
	- methodology to avoid double counting
- economic activities
	- explanation of relevant activities
- additional information
	- relevant background information

### Taxonomy Table
- for each of Revenue, CAPEX, OPEX a separate table
- percentage of aligned/not aligned activities
![[eu_taxonomy_table.png]]

## Legal Stuff
- EU 2020/852
	- + delegated act 2021/2139 (objectives 1-2)
	- + delegated act 2023/2485 (objectives 1-2)
	- + delegated act 2023/2486 (objectives 3-6)
	- + delegated act 2022/1214 (include nuclear and gas energy)
		- transitional only
- official tools
	- [[EU Taxonomy Compass]] (very helpful)
		- [[NACE codes]]
	- EU Taxonomy Calculator
	- EU Taxonomy FAQs C/2023/305

## Parents/Subsidiaries
- each subsidiary large enough has to report on their own, even if included in parents consolidated report
- subsidiaries not large enough to report on their own can be just included in parent company

# Environmental Objectives (art 9)
1. climate change mitigation
2. climate change adoption -> similar to [[E1]]
mandatory before 2024
---
mandatory after 2024
4. sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources -> similar to [[E3]]
5. transition to a circular economy #todo finish ESRS similarities
6. pollution prevention and control
7. protection and restoration of biodiversity

## What to do?
- **Taxonomy Eligibility**: screening of economic activities
	- if it is listed, it **can** be aligned
- substantial contribution
	- to one of [[#Environmental Objectives (art 9)|the objectives]]
- do no significant harm
	- to other [[#Environmental Objectives (art 9)|the objectives]] than the contributed to one
- minimum safeguards
- = taxonomy alignment

# Shortcomings
- political
	- some unsustainable practices deemed as sustainable and vice versa e.g. Germany and gas power generation
- quite technical
- only focus on environment
	- very little social or governance aspects
		- there are plans to integrate a social aspect as well
			- would include: decent work, adequate living standards, inclusive & sustainable societies
		- finalization not before 2025, probably later
- minimal safeguards
- does not prohibit unsustainable activities, only disclosure requirement
	- [[Transparency Theory]] is a thing tho
- exhaustive list
	- economic activities can be missing -> [[All Activities in an Economy - Sustainable View]]
	- e.g. company is reporting 50% not-aligned, 20% aligned, 30% not-eligible
		- 30% not eligible **can** be sustainable, but are not even included, because exhaustive list
