$$HHI = \sum^N_{i=1} s_i^2$$

Only applicable to horizontal mergers -> vertical mergers cut the different dimension (many markets)

- HHI before merger: (40^2 + 30^2 + 30^2) = 3.400
- HHI after merger: (70^2 + 30^2) = 5.800
- delta: 2.400 
- deltas of more than 1.000 are moderate in horizontal mergers 
- deltas of more than 2.500 are critical in horizontal mergers
