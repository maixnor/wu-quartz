My ideas 

## 1. Internalizing Smoking-related healthcare Externalities
question: how expensive would a pack of cigarettes have to be to include external increased costs in the healthcare system?

argument: there is a tobacco tax in Austria, but just for the government to get some of the money back. Smoking and the resulting health damages (should) result in massive losses for the State - which should be funded by smokers themselves - not by others.  

data sources: pubmed for medical data (increased likelyhood of illness); statistik austria, eurostat, WHO for costs of treatments related to smoking  
  
## 2. Economic Chance of mitigating Falling Injuries  
question: how much money can one save if falling injuries were not so frequent

argument: falling is the 2nd largest injury class - especially slipping/tripping - with a very low fatality rate. An injury class that costs a lot of money without "major negative" health effects. What if one would teach the elderly and children (most endangered demographics) how to fall properly without hurting themselves?  

data sources: WHO/eurostat for falling-related injuries data + treatment costs, conducting field experiments with "courses" teaching falling to ordinary people and a survey afterwards how safe they feel related to falling - potentially leading to a longer-duration study on how such an intervention is altering chances of injuries (young people) and mortality (elderly).
