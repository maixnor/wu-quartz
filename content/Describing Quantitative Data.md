# Qualitative Data
- no numbers -> only categories
- absolute frequency: amount of data points fitting a description (category)
	- e.g. passengers being male and in 2nd class
	- base for bar charts
- relative frequency: relative amount of data points fitting a description (category)
	- e.g. 70% of passengers are male
	- base for pie charts
	- `category | absolute freq | relative freq`
	- `   SUM   |       n       |     1`
