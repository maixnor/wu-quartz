# Concepts
## Absolute vs Relative Poverty
- economic growth -> reduction in absolute poverty
	- covid reversed some of that
- below 2.1 USD not sufficient for productive life
	- different measure is needed
- social exclusion -> relative poverty
	- poor people vs rich people
	- if there were no rich people there would be no poor people
	- high income -> high relative poverty rate
- Sissors of average income
	- top 1% rising
	- bottom 50% dropping
- what is interesting? 
	- Opportunity or Outcomes?
	- how to measure income?
	- how to measure inequality?

## Opportunity or Outcome?
- example running race
	- opportunity -> start
	- outcome -> leaderbord
- related
	- fixing one will fix the other
- measuring [[Income]]
	- sum (earnings of participants) + capital income + private transfers
	- = household market income
	- #todo how to get this calculation
	- = household equivalised disposable income
		- different scalings with larger households
			- transport -> exponential
			- food -> linear
			- heating -> constant
	- + value of [[Public Services]] (education, public transport, etc)
	- = Household extended Income

## Based Justice
- based
- very based
- #todo fill from slides
### Needs Based Justice
### Performance Based Justice
### Market Based Justice
### Opportunity Based Justice
### Participatory Justice
### Environmental Justice

## Measure Inequality
- [[GINI Index]]
	- higher GINI Index -> higher inequality
- Upper Tail Inequailty -> 90:50 ratio, 99:90 ratio, 100:99 ratio
- Lower Tail Inequality -> 50:10 ratio
- Mean/Median ration -> Greater outliers on top/bottom of income distribution
## Why should I care?
- endogenous fiscal policy
	- #todo slides
- human capital accumulation theory
	- untapped potential 
	- e.g. education
		- poorer children leaving school earlier
- higher shares of rich
	- lower propensity to consume
		- more saving
		- less re-investment or spending
- negative link of inequality and growth
	- OECD study #todo find that study
	- mostly due to human capital accumulation theory
- Book [[The Spirit Level]] by [[Richard Wilkinson]] and [[Kate Pickett]]
	- life expectancy
	- physical health
	- mental health
	- drug abuse
	- obesity
# Consequences
### Life Expectancy
- #todo get image from life expectancy/income diagram
	- higher development -> higher life expectancy
	- income is pointless -> money cannot be eaten
		- income can only pay for healthcare etc
- #todo get image of tube system with life exptancy
### Linked Social Aspects
- #todo get diagram of inequality vs health and social problems
	- correlation between inequality and social health
- other linked aspects
	- CO2 emissions
	- democracy
	- crime (and status anxiety)
	- education
	- health
# Causes
### Direct Access
- Lack of access to 
	- health care
	- good food
	- plenty exercise
	- education
### Status Anxiety
- not on top of the monkey rock
- low [[Social Status]]
- social hierarchy / ladder
- leading to stress, leading to poor health
### Others
- [[Stress]] in the womb
- parents socio-economic status

## Education
- parent's income significant in children's performance
- babies already affected by parents'income 
- IQ is related to income of parents
- just knowledge of social status degrades performance
- black/white students perform significantly different in "knowledge tests" but the same in "problem solving tests"
	- african-american students perform worse in "knowledge tests"

## Social Graduation
- due to [[Social Status]], not due to IQ or Ability
- #todo get more from slides (56)
- positive feedback look -> reinforcing effects

## Populist Voting
#todo get from slides
- [[Dani Rodrik]] #todo reference

## Climate Change
- related to [[Climate Change]]
	- #todo reference to Emissions
	- #todo reference to Emissions 
	- #todo reference to Emissions Distributions
- [[Climate Change Policies by Social Status]]
	- [[Fossil Fuel Lobby]] challenging most anti-fossil-fuel concepts/legislations

## Education Gap
#todo fix heading
- demand for university students was hit
	- pay decreased
- #todo slides get image from skill percentile to tasks
- higher skill level -> more abstract, less routine and manual tasks

### Automation Impact
- Most middle-skilled jobs automated by computers
- high-skilled jobs still in high demand
- low-skilled jobs hard to automate -> not yet obsolete
- 47% of jobs will be destroyed in the next 20 years (USA)
