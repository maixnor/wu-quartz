# Economic approaches and socio-economics
- What should economics focus on?
- What can different approaches contribute?
- Why socio-economics?

#todo get table from slides

## Mainstream Economics
- neoclassical economics
	- scarcity
	- trade-offs
	- marginal thinking
	- incentives
- mathematical models
	- abstraction
	- assumptions
	- relationships
- postivist view
	- positive statements
	- can be tested, confirmed
	- read off "reality" from empirical facts

Advantages:
- rigorous and transparent language
- results and benchmarks
- check, wether knowledge claims are logically consistent
- identify assumptions necessary to obtain a particular outcome

But:
- based on a particular theory of science, logical positivism
- other approaches: 
	- critical realism
	- hermeneutics
- often less focus on 
	- falsification
	- status of empirical facts
	- importance on "positionality" of researcher

## Socioeconomics
- Multi-Disciplinary and Muti-Perspective thinking
- The economy is not an independant entity separate from society
- all decisions have **political** and **moral** results
- actors do not have a level playing field
- markets without **regulations** and **instituations** would destruct society
- economic explanations cannot be reduced to single individuals

## Trade and Growth
Correlational Effect clearly present
[[Prebish-Singer Hypothesis]]
Causal effect of trade and growth -> [[Instrumental Variable Estimation]]
[[Stolper-Samuelson Theorem]]

### Environmental Depletion
- more trade requires more depletion for transportation
- as countries grow richer they tend to get less pollutend
- empirical data for both sides is present
	- neither direction is proven/can be proven currently
- pollution haven
	- pollution without large fees
	- not enough empirical data to see if that happens
	- companies which offshore product seem to be cleaner than domestic producers
