$$\bar{x}_n \sim N( \mu_{\bar{x}}, \sigma_{\bar{x}})$$
$$\bar{x}_n \sim N( \mu, \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}})$$
- when $n$ is large enough (large sample size) then we can assume the sample mean $\bar{x}$ to be equivalent to population mean $\mu$
	- it is not equivalent, but close enough realistically
- then the standard deviation
- basically we can use $s$ for $\sigma$
	- $\sigma$ is rarely known, so we need to work around that
