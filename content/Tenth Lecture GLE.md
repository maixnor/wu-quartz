## EU Competences
- The capacity to act (through secondary or tertiary law) requires a respective competence of the EU
- The EU competences are defined by primary law
	- Power of conferral
		- When Member transfers power to EU, the state loses power
	- Principle of subsidiarity
		- EU should only act if they do it better at the EU level than that of the member states
	- Limited by the principle of proportionality
		- EU should use its competences only if it’s necessary to achieve a specific aim
- There are 3 main types of competences
	- Exclusive competences
		- The only person allowed to act is EU
	- Shared competences
	- Competencies to support, coordinate or supplement the actions of the MS
## EU legal acts
- Primary Law
	- Treaties under international law
	- Agreed upon by the Member States
- Secondary Law
	- Legal acts based upon primary law
	- Eg regulations, directives
- Tertiary Law
	- Legal acts based upon secondary law
		- Eg decisions
			- Can be general or individual
			- Decisions can have a legislative nature (general)
		- Usually it’s the commission deciding
- Binding Acts
	- Binding acts can be adopted in the form of regulations, directives, decisions
- Non-Binding Acts
	- Can be adopted in the form of recommendations and opinions (TFEU) and others
## Judicial Protection in EU
- Three procedures are most important
	- Infringement proceedings
		- Member State is found to have failed to fulfill an obligation under EU law
		- Member State fails to comply with judgment -> ECJ may impose lump sum or penalty payment
	- Annulment Actions
		- Legislative acts of an EU institution that produces legal effects vis-a-vis third parties
			- Another form within the EU about violating EU law
			- If laws at some level violate the law above
				- Tertiary violating secondary
				- Secondary violating primary
		- Grounds: lack of competence, infringement of an essential procedural requirement, infringement of the Treaties or of any rule of law relating to their application or misuse of power
	- Preliminary Reference Procedure
		- Questions concerning the interpretation and validity of EU law
		- National Courts can and national courts of last instance must refer, if such questions arise in proceedings before them
		- “Infringement procedure of the European citizen”
## EU Law as “Supranational Law”
- EU law has direct effect
	- Usually the states have to implement everything
- EU law enjoys supremacy vis-a-vis national law

## Dynamics of EU Integration
- Regional transformation of unprecedented dynamism because of:
	- Formal Principles
		- Direct Effect
		- Supremacy
		- Preliminary Reference Procedure
	- Substantive Principles
		- Internal market law
		- Principle of mutual recognition
			- If you got permission for a product in one country, you can bring it to market it in another country
- These are the fundamental Principles that contribute to a self-sustaining transformation process
## Internal market
- Markets of all Member States form one common market
	- Daily experience of EU citizen means that they can freely decide where to work
	- You can decide where you buy your goods or services
Forms of Economic Integration
- Free Trade Area
	- Eliminate customs duties and other restrictive regulations
	- Different national tariffs for goods imported from third countries
	- Need to determine origin of products and to impose compensating tariffs
- Customs Union
	- Common customs tariff and trade policy vis a vis third countries
- Internal Market
	- Free movement of all factors of production
- EU: fundamental freedoms
	- Optimal allocation of factors of production, incurring and international division of labor, economies of scale and an increase in wealth
	- Stabilization of Europe through highly increased political and social integration
## Positive and Negative Integration
- Positive Integration entails harmonization
	- The EU is adoption legislation in order to harmonize regulations across Europe
	- How can the EU harmonize to affect the internal market?
		- EU needs a competence
			- Art 114 TFEU
				- EU measures must contribute to removing appreciable obstacles to trade or distortions of competition and may also address anticipated problems as well as non-economic concerns
				- Exceptions Art 114 para. 4 & 5
					- Member state can keep their own legislation if the state needs their own rule to maintain something on legitimate grounds
						- Public health, safety, etc
						- Must notify the commission and the commission will tell the member if they are allowed to keep it
					- After the adoption of EU harmonization, the member discovers new scientific evidence that the EU law will affect that specific member state
- Negative integration is driven forward by individuals interested in their internal market rights and by courts
	- If we have an Austrian company who wants to sell its products to another EU state (Belgium) and the company learns that in Belgium, specific requirements for the product are still enforced. 
		- The Austrian company can go to Belgian courts and say that their freedom for free movement of goods has been violated
## Fundamental Freedoms
- Common Structures
	- Scope of Protection
		- Preliminary Question: Is there a cross-border economic activity
			- Relevant for any application of fundamental freedom
			- In-country, fundamental freedoms aren’t applied
	- Interference
		- Discrimination
			- Direct
				- If a person or a product or a service or good are subject to discrimination or disadvantages explicitly on the basis of foreign origin
			- Indirect
				- Disadvantage on grounds of criteria that regularly disadvantages people of foreign origin
	- Justification
		- Grounds explicitly mentioned in TFEU
		- Mandatory Requirements
	- Test of proportionality
		- We make a balance between the restriction on the one side and the aim on the other side
		- Only if the balance between these elements is fair, is the interference justified.
	- Other common characteristics:
		- Direct effect
		- Supremacy
		- State liability
		- Horizontal effect
## Free Movement of Goods
- Scope of Protection
	- Goods: “products which can be valued in money and which are capable, as such, of forming the subject of a commercial transaction”
		- Tariff Trade Barriers= Customs duties, international discriminatory taxation
			- No Justification
		- Non-Tariff barriers = quantitative restrictions + MEE (Measures Having and Equivalent Effect)
			- Discrimination
				- Direct
				- Indirect
	- Products in free circulation
- Interference
- Justification
