Prospect theory, developed by psychologists Daniel [[Kahneman]] and Amos [[Tversky]], is a [[behavioral economics]] concept that explores how individuals make decisions under [[uncertainty]]. It suggests that people often deviate from traditional economic rationality, exhibiting risk aversion when faced with potential gains and risk-seeking behavior when confronted with potential losses. 

In other words, individuals tend to evaluate potential outcomes based on perceived gains or losses from a reference point rather than absolute values. 

This departure from classical economic assumptions helps explain various [[decision-making]] patterns and has significant implications for understanding economic behavior and policy.
