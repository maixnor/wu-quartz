# Functions of Taxes
- governments get revenue from tax
	- in Austria 40% - 45% of total GDP (high tax country)
	- large amounts of GDP are taken by the government
- business / taxpayers have a cost of living/existing
	- e.g. [[Income Tax]]
- society pays a price for Civilization ([[Oliver Wendell Holmes]])
	- e.g. [[VAT]]
	- budgetary foundation for [[Fiscal System]]
	- taxes are not a donation (i.e. hard requirement)
	- [[black market]] -> outside of taxed domain
		- the worse the tax system, the larger the black markets

> Tax is the Price we pay for Civilization.

&amp; Oliver Wendell Holmes
### Usage of Tax, Tax Spending
- [[Pension Systems]]
- Welfare and Health Systems
- Essential Infrastructure (Roads, Rail, etc)
- Education (School, University)
- Public Transport
- Subsidies
### Measuring the importance of tax
- Tax to GDP ratio
- "high" and "low" tax countries
	- low tax countries also spend less (can't spend more than you earn)
- is there a "right" or "fair" level of tax
# Definition of Tax
- only one of them
	- compulsory
	- imposed by legislation / levied by the government
	- under the [[Rule of Law]]
	- for a public purpose
	- not paid in exchange for specific service 
		- e.g. paying into welfare system even though you are not sick at the moment
		- if taxes are too high for the "value" one receives 
			- more inclined to vote for tax reduction
			- try to commit [[Tax Evasion]]
- who is imposing the taxes?
	- federal government
	- subnational government (Laender)
	- municipal (Gemeinde)
# Redistribution Effect
- some people pay a lot of taxes 
	- businesses
	- high income people
	- etc
- some people pay a little to almost no taxes
	- students
	- children
	- etc
- but all people get comparable support from the state
	- streets can be used by everyone equally
	- public schools are equal for everyone
	- public welfare system is equal for everyone
	- etc
- heavy tax payers are overpaying
- light tax payers are underpaying
- that is just how it is
	- but balancing can and should (and is) happening
# Types of Taxes
- [[Income Tax]]  
- [[Corporate income tax]]  
- Value added tax ([[VAT]]) / goods and services taxes (GST) / sales taxes  
- [[Wealth taxes]]  
	- Inheritance and gift taxes  
	- Real estate transfer taxes  
-  [[Consumption taxes]]  
	-  Energy taxes  
-   Etc. etc. etc.  

-  Is there a perfect tax mix?
	- e.g. US relying mostly on Income tax, Europe mostly based on VAT
	- there is not one perfect tax mix, depending on country, culture, climate, next election, trends, etc
	- corporate tax payers do not vote -> not natural persons
	- income tax payers do vote -> will hit you back next election
-  What actually guides the policy design of a tax system?
# Purpose of Tax
- fiscal justification can justify anything -> pointless in this discussion
- influence behavior
	- e.g. tobacco tax -> more expensive tobacco results in less consumption
		- tobacco tax: conflicting interests
			- health reasons: perfect tax rate would be infinite -> no tobacco products at all
			- fiscal reasons: making money with it
			- equilibrium: what is the highest price I can ask so people still smoke, so I make money (avoids black markets) 
- price-in external cost ([[Externalities]]) ([[Pigouvian Taxes]])
	- e.g. fuel tax -> more expensive fuel leads to less driving
		- causing external costs (polluting the environment)
		- should be priced into the product (fuel)
- pursue non-tax goals
	- e.g. tax exemptions, non-deductions
# Who Decides?
> The power to tax is the power to govern

> Taxes are politics converted into money

- tax sovereignty could lead to tax competition
	- e.g. most online businesses in US registered in Delaware
- international agreements (tax treaties)
### European Union [[EU]]
- [[VAT]] - fully harmonizes (except tax rate 15%-27%)
	- makes sense for harmonized market
- income tax -> not harmonized
- corporate income tax
	- Hungary has <10% corporate income tax, Austria has 23%
	- corporates can move easily, people not so much
- anti tax avoidance directive -> against [[Tax Evasion]]
- EU fundamental freedoms -> non-discrimination
- prohibition of state aid
