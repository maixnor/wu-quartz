# Types of Tax Reduction
## Tax Planning
- playing by the rules to achieve lower taxes
## Tax Avoidance
- playing by the rules to achieve lower taxes
- **but** you are not following the spirit of the law
## Tax Evasion
- passively hiding information from tax authorities to achieve lower taxes
	- e.g. not declaring income
## Tax Fraud
- actively falsifying information to achieve lower taxes
	- e.g. faking/altering documents
# BEPS

### Debt
- high debt is beneficial for tax planning/tax avoidance
- paying interest reduces profit
- reduced profit -> reduced corporate tax
- interest deduction limitation aims to alleviate this
	- only up to gearing of 3 is deductible
	- i.e. up to 3x debt vs equity is deductible
# Case Study 1
- ATAD Art. 4
	- EU Directive
	- passed in only 6 months (super quick)
- givens:
	- 5mn EBITDA rental income
	- 4.5mn interest expense
- basically: is interest expense tax deductible?
	- **all** debt payments are caught
	- only 30% of EBITDA is deductible
	- only applies beyond 3mn of net interest expense
	- not applicable for financial undertakings (bank, insurance)
	- therefore: 3mn + (5mn * 0.3) = 4.5mn tax deductible
		- first 3mn are deductible anyways -> 3mn
		- after 30% of EBITDA -> 1.5mn
	- conclusion: full amount of interest expense is deductible in this case
# Case Study 2 (Panama)
- givens:
	- company A (25% tax, country X)
	- company B (0% tax, country Y)
	- A holds 100% of B
	- B generates 10mn in year 1
	- B distributes 10mn in dividends to A in year 2
- how/when/where is the profit (10mn) taxed?
	- year 1
		- income taxed in parent company (25%)
			- 2.5mn
	- year 2
		- dividend distribution
		- no extra tax 
# CFC
- [[CFC]] 
# Case Study 3
- givens:
	- sole entrepreneur with start-up
	- sets up company to save tax
		- company income tax rate: 25%
		- personal income tax rate: 50%
- conclusion:
	- not so smart (at least for tax purpose)
		- main reason should be [[Limited Liability]], rather than lower income tax
		- or main reason should be that with a company only **profit** is taxed, not **gross income**
	- still extraction from company for personal profit is due to personal income tax -> effectively same tax burden
# GAAR
- ATAD Art. 6
	- obtaining tax advantage which defeats the purpose of the law
	- non-genuine commercial reasons 
- GAARs allow to ignore legal structuring when dealing with taxation
- Questions:
	- Is the object or purpose of the law defeated?
	- What is the object or purpose of the law?
# Case Study 4 - Exit Tax
- Givens
	- unrealized capital gains of 400
	- state X (current residence) tax rate: 25%
	- state Y (migration location) tax rate: 0%
- Tax Effect
	- in this case study relevant taxation 
		- unrealized capital gains cannot be taxed normally
		- exit tax is an exception to this (fictitious sale)
# Exit Tax
- migration from state X to state Y (applicable even within EU)
- At the exit of state X, state X has last chance to tax the company
	- therefore tax liabilities become liable right away, instead of at end of year
	- state X has significant and justified interest in taxation
- even unrealized capital gains are taxed (normally not possible)
	- profit = fictitious sale price - book value
- tax burdens reasons are not yet realized, therefore company may not have funds to pay tax burden immediately
	- state X may offer the company to pay tax burden within 5 years
# Case Study 5 - Arms Length
- [[At Arms Length]] is technically illegal
- but it very hard to actually prove
	- if patent is unique it is very hard to find a comparable transaction and judge the market price
- possible double taxationl
# Quiz 2
## Double Personal Taxation
- limited tax liability: only as much as earned in state X
- unlimited tax liability: all income from all countries
- correct answer: unlimited in UK (residency) and limited in AT (only income)
## Double Corporate Taxation
- juridical double taxation
	- same income taxed twice for same company
- no double taxation
	- same income only taxed once
- economic double taxation
	- same income taxed twice for 2 companies
- profits generated in Belgium, siphoned off to US
	- same profits are taxed in Belgium and in US
	- correct: economic double taxation
- [[Tax Treaty]]
## Mandatory OECD MC
- [[OECD]] MC is not mandatory
	- template for a [[Tax Treaty]] between countries
	- only a model - something to copy and tailor to your needs
- soft law - although very successful
	- most tax treaties follow this model -> [[Tax Treaty]]
## Distributive Rules
- distributive rules allocate taxing rights non-exclusively to one of the two contracting states. Both states have *a* taxing right, just not the *complete* tax right.
## DTC
- what is the purpose of a [[Tax Treaty]] DTC?
	- Reduction/Elimination of double taxation (main purpose)
	- Facilitating administrative cooperation (added benefit)
		- prevention of tax evasion/fraud
	- **never** increasing tax liability
		- only ever limit the tax liability within a single tax jurisdiction
