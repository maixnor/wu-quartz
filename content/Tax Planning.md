# Types of Tax Reduction
## Tax Planning
- playing by the rules to achieve lower taxes
## Tax Avoidance
- playing by the rules to achieve lower taxes
- **but** you are not following the spirit of the law
## Tax Evasion

### Debt
- high debt is beneficial for tax planning/tax avoidance
- paying interest reduces profit
- reduced profit -> reduced corporate tax
- interest deduction limitation aims to alleviate this
	- only up to gearing of 3 is deductible
	- i.e. up to 3x debt vs equity is deductible
# Case Study 1
- ATAD Art. 4
	- EU Directive
	- passed in only 6 months (super quick)
- givens:
	- 5mn EBITDA rental income
	- 4.5mn interest expense
- basically: is interest expense tax deductible?
	- **all** debt payments are caught
	- only 30% of EBITDA is deductible
	- only applies beyond 3mn of net interest expense
	- not applicable for financial undertakings (bank, insurance)
	- therefore: 3mn + (5mn * 0.3) = 4.5mn tax deductible
		- first 3mn are deductible anyways -> 3mn
		- after 30% of EBITDA -> 1.5mn
	- conclusion: full amount of interest expense is deductible in this case
