### Debt
- high debt is beneficial for tax planning/tax avoidance
- paying interest reduces profit
- reduced profit -> reduced corporate tax
- interest deduction limitation aims to alleviate this
	- only up to gearing of 3 is deductible
	- i.e. up to 3x debt vs equity is deductible
# Case Study 1
- ATAD Art. 4
	- EU Directive
	- passed in only 6 months (super quick)
- givens:
	- 5mn EBITDA rental income
	- 4.5mn interest expense
- basically: is interest expense tax deductible?
	- **all** debt payments are caught
	- only 30% of EBITDA is deductible
	- only applies beyond 3mn of net interest expense
	- not applicable for financial undertakings (bank, insurance)
	- therefore: 3mn + (5mn * 0.3) = 4.5mn tax deductible
		- first 3mn are deductible anyways -> 3mn
		- after 30% of EBITDA -> 1.5mn
	- conclusion: full amount of interest expense is deductible in this case
# Case Study 2 (Panama)
- givens:
	- company A (25% tax, country X)
	- company B (0% tax, country Y)
	- A holds 100% of B
	- B generates 10mn in year 1
	- B distributes 10mn in dividends to A in year 2
- how/when/where is the profit (10mn) taxed?
	- year 1
		- income taxed in parent company (25%)
			- 2.5mn
	- year 2
		- dividend distribution
		- no extra tax
