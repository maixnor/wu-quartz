# Law of One Price
- result ... no-friction world -> [[Market Entry Barriers|barriers]] removed
- Walras system of equations
- similar to "natural price" of [[Adam Smith]] but with spatial dimension
- equilbrium seldom reached
	- high transport cost
	- information asymmetries
	- slow adjustment time / slow information exchange

# *Weak* Law of one Price
- bc of transport, etc costs prices are never the same
- BUT prices move together
	- falling prices in place X is similar to falling prices in Y
