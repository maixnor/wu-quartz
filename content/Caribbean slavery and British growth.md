# CARIBBEAN SLAVERY AND BRITISH GROWTH
Eric [[Williams Hypothesis]]

## üìé Executive Summary
This paper supports the hypothesis that [[slavery]] in the British West Indies significantly contributed to English industrial growth in the late 18th century. The author raises objections to prior criticisms of Williams's work and uses a [[Cobb-Douglas]] model to demonstrate the quantitative importance of this contribution.

## ‚ùóConclusion
The paper concludes that colonial slavery increased British national income, boosted the pool of investable funds, and resulted in a trade pattern that encouraged industrialization, reaffirming aspects of Williams's thesis.

## üëÅÔ∏è Key Findings
- Confirms the significant role of slave colonies in British economic growth.
- Highlights the quantitative importance of slavery-related profits for industrialization.
- Challenges earlier critiques of the [[Williams hypothesis]], evidencing support for a complex relationship between slavery and economic development.

## ‚úÖ Similarities
- Aligns with the views presented in earlier works by [[Anstey]] (1968) and [[Coetho]] (1973) regarding the economic impacts of colonial trade. [[Colonialism]]
- Explores themes consistent with Darity's model on the implications of trade on European technology and African socio-economic disruption. [[Darity Model]]

## ‚öîÔ∏è Differences
- Differentiates from Engerman (1972, 1975) and Drescher (1977) in terms of the interpretation of slavery's [[profitability]] and economic contributions.
- Offers a distinct approach to Williams's ideas by employing a simpler [[Cobb-Douglas]] model, contrasting with other methodologies used in critiques.
