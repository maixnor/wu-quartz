> No-one can "opt out" of economic issues and decisions. Our only options are to be informed, uninformed, or misinformed

&amp; Thomas Sowell, Basic, Economics, 2015

### Econimic Thinking
- What do I need/want
	- not enough thought about why one wants 
- FOMO influences buying decisions
- What are my options?
	- not researching other offers
	- what are the costs (including [[Opportunity Cost]]) and benefits of different options
- What are the consequences of my choises
	- myself, others, enviroment

FOMO ... fear of missing out
