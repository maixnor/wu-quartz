Formula: [[Assets]] - [[Liabilities]]

Losses and Profits decrease/increase the Equity.

Any loss reduces the Equity Capital (Amount of Equity).
-> should there be no or very little [[Liquidity]], then the company will go bankrupt very quickly

Higher Equity Capital -> more resilience
A resilient company can endure multiple years of losses, a company with mostly liability capital cannot endure as many losses before going [[Bankruptcy|bankrupt]]
