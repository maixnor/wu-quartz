## History
- [[submodules/wu-quartz/content/John von Neumann|John von Neumann]] 1928
- [[John Nash]] 1949
	- theory of Neumann and Morgenstern
	- [[Nash Equilibrium]]
## Games and Competition
- sequential or constant game
![[FM_game_theory.png]]
- game plan
	- each player has a predefined action/reaction trees
	- imagine chess with pre-planned moves (e.g. chess openings)
	- no game plan for chess (too many options)
### Assumptions
- every actor understands the payoffs of the game
- players have preferences
- [[Rationality]] - all players are rational -> maximize payoffs
- common knowledge
	- all information is available to everyone
	- everyone knows that all information is known by everyone
- players have unlimited reasoning and calculation ability
#### Criticism
- players are not rational
- not all players have all knowledge
### Nash Equilibrium
- [[Nash Equilibrium]]
- for all players the utility has been maximized
	- i.e. sticking to the current (best) option, since every other option is inferior
- #todo math notation
### Payoff Matrix
- $N$ - dimensional -> $N$ ... number of players
- $m \times m$ matrix -> $m$ ... number of strategies of players
	- square if all players have same (number of) strategies
- Rock-Paper-Scissors with 2 players
	- 2-dimensional matrix. 3x3 (rock, paper, scissors are the strategies of both players)
## Types of Games
- static/simultaneous vs dynamic/sequential
- pure-strategy equilibrium vs mixed-strategy equilibrium
- complete information vs incomplete information
	- information asymmetry -> [[Economics of Information]]
	- we will only cover complete information in [[FM Foundations in Microeconomics|Micro]]
### Solutions of a Static Game
- find the possible strategies of all players
- determine the payoffs
- find optimal strategies of all players
- reach [[Nash Equilibrium]]
#### Strategies
- dominant strategy
	- whatever the others are doing a specific strategy is always the best
	- player-specific, not all agents have to have the same dominant strategy
- dominated strategy
	- whatever the others are doing a specific strategy will always be inferior to another strategy
#### Multiple Equilibria - Battle of the Sexes
- when 2 strategies are exactly opposite to one another
- combination of all payoffs are equally beneficial
