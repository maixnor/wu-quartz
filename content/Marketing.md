How to communicate with customers.

Aim is to sell more for higher prices leading to increased revenue and higher margins.

Great marketing campaigns combine multiple strategies to deliver the best value.

# Strategies

## Mouth to Mouth
Just people talking to each other recommending great products or sharing solutions to their problems. There is no direct incentive for the marketing effort by the customers like an affiliate program where the communicator can gain a benefit. For more on that see [[#Affiliate]]  

## Affiliate
Give away part of your margin for others to do the marketing. This is a clever way to mostly remove the need for you to market to direct customers. Rather you search for marketing partners which will handle the marketing for you and you will have to give away parts of your margin to the marketing provider for generating you a customer stream.

The compensation can be done either monetarily (mostly with B2C marketing) or with other benefits like free subscription period with mobile apps (C2C marketing).
