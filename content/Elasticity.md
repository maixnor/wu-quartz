$EL_x f(x) = \frac{x}{f(x)} f'(x) = \frac{\frac{df(x)}{f(x)}}{\frac{dx}{x}}$

Ratio of change in $f(x)$ to the percentage change in $x$ in %.

[[Marginal Changes]] ... if we increase the price by 1%, the demand changes by x%.

The Derivative and the Elasticity share their sign.

$D(P) = -10P+400$
$EL_P D(P) = \frac{P}{-10P+400} * (-10) = \frac{-10P}{-10P + 400}$
