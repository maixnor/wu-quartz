# Definition
> where trade is happening across borders (physical, geographical, etc)

## Factors
- [[Movement of X]] becomes more free
- availability and demand of goods - more absolute supply/demand = better integration 
- production costs differ in different places - more difference = better integration
- transaction & transport costs - lower = better integration
- financial risk & [[Opportunity Cost]] - lower = better integration

## Measure
- trade amount / ratio of [[GDP]]
- amount of [[Movement of X]]
- similarity of prices in different places -> [[Law of One Price]]
	- at least prices move together -> "weak law of one price"

## Model
![[market_integration_model.png]]
- with 0 transport cost ... [[Arbitrage]]

## Historic for Normal Goods (Wheat)
- ratio of US / UK wheat price 
	- > 1 ... US > UK
	- < 1 ... UK > US
	- = 1 ... about same
- with rising integration ratio approaches 1
### Ratio

### Absolute Prices

### Absolute Trade
![[trade_wheat_us_uk.png]]
- left scaled appropriately
- UK imported US wheat
### Price Ratios 1806-1913
- higher market integration than before

## Comparison to Special goods (Pepper)
- special goods are not converging as fast as normal goods
