Science vs Pseudo-Science

For something to be scientific it needs to be 2 things
- logically consistent
	- if it rains, the floor gets wet
- needs to be falsifiable
	- theory: all swans are white
	- how to falsify: find a non-white swan
	- if I can't find a white swan
		- "I cannot falsify the theory yet"
		- but the theory is not proven
# Errors
## Type I - false positive
- the prisoner is found guilty, but is innocent
- $1 - \alpha$
## Type II - false negative
- the prisoner is not found guilty, but has committed the crime
- $\beta$ ... $(1-\beta)$ = power of a test
	- not relevant, but for future studies
