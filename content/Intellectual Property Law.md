mostly international and EU law


# Definition of IP

- Industrial Property -> used by companies
- Copyright -> artistic

- *numerous clausus* of IP laws -> there is a set amount of rules, one cannot make any more intellectual property up
- 40% of EU GDP is IP related
	- Trademarks
	- Intangible Goods
	- Patents
	- Information

# Why Protection
- problem: hard to create, easy to copy
- cost of information = cost of copying
	- almost 0 with digital goods
- moral rights to be associated to ones creation
- promote creativity
- downside: monopolies can be formed

## Copyright
- aquisition: creation
- only on works, not ideas
- exclusive rights
- 70 years after death of creator
- exception:
	- private copy (not selling/passing on)
- sources of copyright
	- [[Berne Convention]]
	- [[TRIPS]]
	- EU Directives (2001/29/EC and 2019/790)
- what is protected? literary, scientific and artistic domain
- what is not protected? news
- creators/authors can only be humans (monkeys do not have copyright)
	- also companies cannot create copyright (but they get it anyway through employment contract), but still individual stays the creator
	- authorship cannot be given away, just the usage rights/license
- Permitted Acts
	- reproduction for private use -> private copy
	- accidental copy -> music video running in background of video
	- quote -> as long as you quote the source it is fine
- 
## Trademarks
- aquisition: registration (with fee)
- examples: Adidas logo, Nike swoosh, Mercedes star
- communication between company and consumer (reputation of manufacture)
	- indication of origin/manufacture
- protects the consumer -> being sure of what you are buying
- protects the company -> safeguarding your reputation
- EU trademark laws as well as 27 member state trademark laws
- EU has its trademark office
- Austria has patent office, doing patents and as well trademarks -> confusing
- WIPO Madrid System -> up to 126 countries

- trademarks can last forever (while paying all the fees)
- what is a trademark exactly?
	- distinctiveness
	- can be put on register
	- words, names, letters, numerals, colors, shapes, packaging, sounds 
	- combinations
- grounds of refusal
	- lack of distinctiveness (generic terms, descriptive signs)
	- contrary to public policy (nudes)
	- functional shapes (LEGO bricks are not trademarked)
	- misleading/deceiving character (Hungarian salami made in Austria)

- trademark is only applicable to trade (playing/costumes not affected)
- marking goods and services
- protect against use by others
	- opposition by trademark owners
		- identical / similar
		- likelihood of confusion for public
		- earlier trademark has reputation

## Patents
- aquisition: registration
- pro:
	- moral -> protecting the creator
	- innovation -> better patents, more innovation
	- disclosure -> publishing patents leads to disclosure
- cons:
	- costs
	- unjust enrichment (large companies)
	- developing countries -> exploitation of poorest

- EU does not have unified Patent Laws
- European unified patent court exists (not EU)

- what is protected?
	- capable of industrial application
	- #todo
- requirements
	- technical invention -> something new
	- novelty -> not part of state of the art
	- inventive step -> can it be built

- ownership
	- first to register wins
	- granted for limited number of years (20 years standard)
		- fair protection with pharmaceuticals if bringing drug to market takes time
	- employee (transferred to employer through contract)
		- can also be transferred to other companies
	- licenses need to be handed out if not used 
- acts of infringement
	- #todo

# Scope of IP right
- exclusive rights
	- negative right to defense -> I don't want my book to be translated
- license agreements
	- exclusive licenses -> right of free use, not right of ownership
	- non-exclusive licenses -> rights granted for special use cases

# International IP law
- [[Hierarchy of Norms]]
- IP is territorial
	- Property Rights apply to each country individually
	- IP in USA is not valid in China
- WIPO (Word Intellectual Property Organization)
- [[WTO]] (World Trade Organization)
	- [[TRIPS]] (Trade-Related aspects of Intellectual Property Rights)
		- National Treatment -> if rights granted to nationals, also to other members
		- (MFN) Most Favourable Nation treatment -> best case for all members
	- gives minimum requirements, more may be added by member state
- no International Trademark
	- "international trademark" is actually 125 individual trademarks
- in EU there is union trademark
- in EU there is NO union patent
- principle of first sale #todo 
- problems: 
	- overprotection, 
	- developing countries not having access to important patents
-
