- each consumer makes individual choices
- aggregation of all consumers creates the demand
- consumer faces value maximization problem

- each company makes individual choices
- aggregation of all companies creates the supply
- company faces profit maximization problem

> Supply and Demand require Competition!
> There cannot be Supply and Demand in a [[Monopoly]].
## Supply
- variable
	- price of the good
- constants (can change over time)
	- technology -> [[Feral Futures]], [[Entrepreneurial Perspective#Disruption|Disruptive Technologies]]
	- prices of inputs
	- taxes
## Demand
- variable
	- price of the good
- constants (can change over time)
	- preferences -> [[Customer Perspective]]
	- income -> [[Poverty]], [[Prahalad]]
	- prices of other goods
## Equilibrium
- intersection of supply and demand function
- [[Game Theory]] -> no need to act by either consumer or producer
- ![[FM_supply_demand_equilibirum.png]]
### Excess Demand
- consumers demand more than suppliers are willing to supply
- price will increase, supply will increase, demand will decrease
- reaching equilibrium eventually -> convergence
![[FM_excess_demand.png]]
### Excess Supply
- consumers demand less than suppliers are willing to supply
- price will decrease, supply will decrease, demand will increase
- reaching equilibrium eventually -> convergence

### Market Mechanism
- there is only too little supply or too little demand
- ![[FM_market_mechanism.png]]
### Movement of Equilibrium
- change of supply inversely affects price
- change of demand directly affects price
## Price Elasticity
- [[Marginal Changes]]
- [[Derivatives#Elasticity]]
- [[Cross-Elasticity]]
	- price elasticity of demand <= 0
	- price elasticity of supply >= 0
- "arc elasticity" ... taking the average slope along a price range
- used for analyzing the sensitivity of different variables
$$E_p = (\%\Delta q)/(\%\Delta p) = \frac{\Delta q}{\Delta p} * \frac{p}{q}$$
