# Globalization | An introduction
- what is globalization?
- enablers of globalization
	- first and second unbundling
- loosers of globalization and "political countermovements"
	- who wins/loses from second unbundling
	- political countermovements
	- the end of [[Hyperglobalization]]?

### What is?
#todo get quotes from slides

### The cost of overcoming distance
- With increased technology the "size" of the world devreases
#todo get image from slides
- time-space compression
- faster turnover time
- capitalism causes the geographical expansion
### Enablers of Globalization
After [[Baldwin]]:

3 constraints:
- Goods Trade Costs
- Communication Costs
- Face-to-Face Costs

Steam revolution decreased goods trade costs
Information and communication revolution decreased communication costs

#### Pre-Globalized World
- high trade cost
- high comms cost
- high f2f cost
Leading to:
- workers and consumers needed to live close by
- very expensive to import/export goods
- local monopolies (cost was still lower than transportation cost)
- limits the size of the market (no [[Economy of Scale]])

### First Unbundling (Steam Revolution)
started in 1820 until 1940 (paused because of WW2)

lower transporation costs lead to:
- geographic expansion, decreased cost of overcoming distance
- turn-over times of capital increase
- quasi-local monopolies disappear
- global markets -> mass produciton
- still high comms and f2f costs

Resulting in:
- Global
	- [[global north]] specialize in manufactured goods
	- [[global south]] specialize in primary commodities, food products
	- division of labour
	- the great [[Divergence]]
	- india/china/africa loose
	- europe, and later USA, win
- cities specialize in production of particular commodities
- knowledge and information remains in the cities and factories of the global north

### Beyond the first unbundling
Many problems still
- econoomic
- political
- socaial
- cultural
- environmental
- innovation
- urbanization 
- trade policies
- slavery
- gunboat diplomacy

general process and contingent historical-geographic factors combine to tell a causal story

## Rebundling (World Wars) 
- world wars put a stop on global trade and integration
- increased fees, focusing on domestic market

## Second Unbundling
- different parts can be produced in different sites

started after 1945
- improvements in transportation
- lower comms cost -> global division of labour
- increases turnover time
- faster product life cycles (e.g. fast fashion)

information and knowledge flow between companies and between [[global north]] and [[global south]].

#### Transportation Tech
- commercial jet aircraft
	- took off (pun unintended) in 1950s
- containerization 
	- enabled mass-transportation
	- incredibly cheap transport costs

#### Shift in Production
Tasks, Products, Assembly is split onto many different people/companies
not a single producer of e.g. airplanes or phones

### Comms Technology
- Satellite and optical fiber technology
- The internet
- Mobile Communication
- Electronic mass media (TV, Radio)
- Intellectual property rights

## A third unbundling?
Face-to-Face Costs remain high

- tacit (non-codified) information exchange is still geographically restricted
- high-tech, financial, and creative industries -> expert industries
	- e.g. Hollywood in LA

### Current World
- low trade barriers
- low transport costs (first unbundling)
- low comms cost (second unbundling)
-> extremely complex global value chains
-> complex global divions of labour based on job and task outsourcing

## Losers of Globalization
### Task outsourcing
- old: All steps of the production by one company
- new: Many steps are delegated (offshored) to other companies

### Stolper-Samuelson (1941)
Elephant Curve #todo get from slides
- string re-distributive implications of free trade models
- model predicts, that unskilled workers will be worse off
- establishes *absolute* losses, not relative losses

### Rodriks additions
- There re loosers from trade
- winners need to compensate the loosers
- redistribution is flipside
- #todo get more from slides

#### Empirical Studies
- #todo get from slides

## Countermovements
- anti-globalization protests
- economic outcomes are linked to political processes
- string political reaction to increasion precarization
- job insecurity, competition in the labor market

### Reactions and its Manifestations
- populist voting
- #todo what the fuck did I do here?
- Left or Right?
	- link to welfare state
	- right wing: if generous and open to all residents 
		-> turns against immigration 
	- left wing: if limited to a few market insiders 
		-> turns against EU, WTO, global finance

### Polanyi's double movement
- #todo get image from slides
- there will always be political backlash to every economic decision
- [[Dani Rodrik#Golden Straightjacket|Golden Straightjacket]]: you have to conform to golden role-model
- [[Dani Rodrik#Bretton Woods Compromise|Bretton Woods Compromise]]: after ww2
- global governance: every person (globally) has a vote (also the [[global south]])

### Backlash
- Rodriks suggests a political backlash
- #todo what should I put here?

- split is more about cultural lines, less about economic lines

### What now?
- have we reached peak globalization?
- no more increase in globalization after 2008

### Key Changes
- similarity to cold war: economic superpowers are fighting over geopolitical power
- "value" of trade is not juts measured by efficiency/profit/revenue but also by e.g. environmental aspects
- move to circular economies / local trade relations -> less emissions
- democracy and market based economies not defined by international law
  -> every country can choose for themselves
- #todo get the end of "in-China for China" from Slides
- stronger focus on "strategic autonomy" and "de-coupling/de-risking" and technological sovereignity
	- chips being produced in EU
	- server farms being built in EU
- China is not just a competitor, but a geopolitical adversary
	- China has almost-monopoly on raw resources for high-tech products (chips, batteries)

### Standard Economic Theory
- helps us understand
	- benefits of trade
	- winners and losers of globalization
	- leads to productivity/efficiency gains
- rarely includes political backlashes etc
	- maybe higher efficiency per company
	- but lower efficiency on marco/global level
- #todo get the rest from slides
