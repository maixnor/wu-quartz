# Geography
![[geography_peru_querschnitt.png]]
- main agriculture in the jungle
- main port is in Lima
- in between is a mountain range 
	- -> need to cross the mountain range to get anything to the global markets
- coast is very flat and dry (desert)
	- large farms with heavy machinery and technology are here
	- all the large cities are here
- jungle is green and fertile
	- many small farms with local farmers and less technology/machinery
## Logistical Challenge
- challenging to bring products to the cost (ports)
	- journey takes ~20 hours
- from 40C in the jungle to -10C on the mountain pigs
	- hard to keep a cooling chain going
- a lot of products are lost (damaged) on the way due to spoiling
	- 70% of products for local markets are lost through the mountains
- problems with infrastructure
	- landslides and poorly maintained roads in the mountains

# Social Aspects
- 70% of people are not formally employed
	- 90% within agriculture sector
	- >90% within the jungle agriculture sector
- informal companies pay less taxes/benefits etc
	- a lot of companies are informal
	- hard to compete otherwise with other informal companies
- certifications are worth a lot
	- getting access to markets informal companies cannot
