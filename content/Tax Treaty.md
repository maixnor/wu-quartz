## Double Taxation Alleviation Methods
### Credit Method
- Art 23A OECD MC
- popular in [[USA]]
- tax must be "paid" but the tax is given 1:1 as credit for the next year
- tax deductions only possible in the next fiscal year
- mostly done via [[Withheld Tax]]
### Exemption Method
- Art 23B OECD MC
- popular in European countries
- taxes simply are exempted, just not paid
- tax deductions take effect immediately / are not even a tax burden in the first place
- [[Progression Safeguard]] applies
### Mixed Method
- e.g. tax treaty between [[USA]] and Germany
- USA might choose [[#Credit Method]] while Germany chooses [[#Exemption Method]] to alleviate double taxation, it is up to the individual country
