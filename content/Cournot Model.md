# Cournot Model
## Assumptions
- 2 firms are competing with each other (oligopoly)
- **Homogeneous good** (no product differentiation)
- **Simultaneous output decisions** (the firms decide how much to produce at the same time)
- **Each firm treats the output level of its competitor as fixed when deciding how much to produce**
- Full information and rationality
### Example: Hotel
A hotel owner chooses how many rooms to build and then sets his price based on the total amount of accommodation available in the resort and the demand level
## Profit Maximization in the Cournot Model
 
$$P=a-bQ_{\text{TOTAL}}\text{ ; }Q_{\text{TOTAL}}=Q_1+Q_2 \text{ and }MC_1=c_1 $$
$$\pi_1(Q_1, Q_2)=$$
$$=R-C=$$
$$=PQ_1-C=$$
$$=(a-bQ)Q_1-c_1Q_1-F_1=$$
$$=(a-bQ_1-bQ_2)Q_1-c1Q1-F_1=$$
$$=aQ_1-bQ^2_1-bQ_2Q_1-c_1Q_1-F_1$$
→  this maximizes $q_1$
when setting derivative to 0:
$$\frac {\delta \pi_1(Q_1,Q_2)}{\delta Q_1}= a-2bQ_1-bQ_2-c_1=0 $$
 $a-2bQ_1-bQ_2$ is $MR_1$ in the above formula
$-c_1$ is  $-MC_1$ in the above formula
$$Q^*_1= \frac {a-bQ_2-c_1}{2b}$$
The **optimal output is a function of the output of the other firm!**
**The more Firm 2 produces, the less Firm 1 will produce**
### Firm 1’s output decision
 ![[IMG-20240607173921338.png]]

- If **Firm 1 thinks that Firm 2 will produce nothing**, then the d**emand curve for Firm 1, $D_1(0)$, is equal to the market demand curve**.
- If **Firm 1 believes that Firm 2 will produce 50 unit**s, the **demand curve facing Firm 1 will move 50 units to the left**.
- If **Firm 1 thinks that Firm 2 will produce 75 units**, the **demand curve facing Firm 1 will move left by 75 units**.
$$\Downarrow$$
- The output of Firm 1 depends on the output decision of Firm 2: the optimal output of Firm 1 decreases as the optimal output of Firm 2 increas<es.

### Reaction Function
 ![[IMG-20240607174219850.png]]

- Firm 1’s reaction curve shows how much it will produce as a function of how much it thinks Firm 2 will produce.
- Firm 2’s reaction curve shows its output as a function of how much it thinks Firm 1 will produce.
- Reaction functions show the relationship between a firm‘s profit maximizing output and the amount it thinks its competitor will produce.

> [!Important] 
> In the Cournot equilibrium, **each firm correctly assumes the amount that its competitor will produce** and **thereby maximizes its own profits**. Therefore, **neither firm will move from this equilibrium**.
### Example: Extreme Duopoly
? similar example in the [[Stackelberg Model]]
a) Two firms are competing in a market with the linear inverse demand function $P=30-Q$ with $Q=Q_1+Q_2$. Calculate the profits of two firms, assuming marginal costs of zero.

$P=30-Q$
$C_1=C_1=0$
→ $\Pi_1(q_1,q_2)=(30-(q_1+q_2))q_1 → \text{max }q_1$
$30-q_1-q_2-q_1=0$
$q_1= \frac {30-q_2}{2}$

→ $\Pi_2(q_2,q_1)=(30-(q_1+q_2))q_2 → \text{max }q_2$
$q_2= \frac {30-q_1}{2}$
BR (best response) of firm 2

→ Nash Equilibrium: $q^*_1=q^*_2=0$
$\Pi_1^*=\Pi_1^*=100$

b) Calculate the profits of the firm, assuming collusion. If the firms collude, they are maximizing joint profits and acting like a monopolist.

 $(30-Q)Q → \text {max } Q$
 $30-2Q=0$
 $Q=15$
 $\Pi^*=225$
