# Welcome Freshmen
You did it. You passed the entrance exam and are some of the lucky ones to study in this undergrad. Now it is time to get started with your studies. 
## WU Services
### Canvas
The main platform where almost everything is happening. Here you find all your assignments and resources. If it is PDFs of papers, links to other sources or simply slides used in the lectures it is all found here.

Canvas also has most grading information, since most courses have either participation or during-semester tasks which are part of the grade, not just the exams. Most Courses also enter your exam results into canvas and then translate the final percentage into the final grade which you will receive.

There are lots of different modules (e.g. files, grading, "modules") and every course has different configurations. It always requires some getting used to with each course and every professor and their team structure their courses differently. Some courses structure the course in weeks (including resources, slides, assignments) while others group same and same (e.g. all slides in one place) while others heavily rely on the files module.
### LPIS
The enrollment in individual courses is done using this service. Here a few points to make sure you are not learning a painful lesson after the first deadline.

The secret to enrolling with highest success rate
- always make sure you know previously exactly which courses you will enroll in
- there might be different sub-courses ^a8b466
	- timeslots, e.g. [[QM1 Quantitative Methods 1]]
	- professors, e.g. [[UBBP Understanding Business]]
	- modes, e.g. [[FS Foundations in Socioeconomics]] (semester 2)  ^27ab63
		- online/offline courses
- know your deadline, there is no other
	- a friend missed the deadline and then could not join us with the course we wanted to take as a group, sad

The moment you have been waiting for has arrived, the deadline.


### MyLearn
The legacy application which was used before Canvas. Some things are still not handled via Canvas, that is why the service still exists.
### Teams
Microsoft Teams. Hate it or love it, it is being used. At least video calls are done using just one platform instead of each professor using individual solutions. There are no handins on Teams, only on Canvas. You might still need do fill out/upload stuff there; e.g. for the [[QM1 Quantitative Methods 1|QM]] interviews you needed to fill out an excel and upload your Case Studies (don't worry about them for now :), you will soon enough) to have the call.

Some classes are thought only online (remember [[#^27ab63|this]]) via video calls. They are regularly organized within channels in separate teams.

Personally I only enrolled in teams for 3 courses, 1 online course, 2 interviews for both QM courses.
