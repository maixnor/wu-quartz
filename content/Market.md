Some think marketing is a philosophy that is present in the whole business.

Marketing is about creating value for the customer through
- customer satisfaction
- creating a Unique Selling Proposition (USP)
- gaining and maintaining market share
- maintaining or increasing sales
- profitability -> higher ROI than interest rate

Market Orientation is about knowing the wants and needs of your customers and providing goods or services to meet those wants and needs or even requirements.

### Marketing Mix
- Product: which products and services
- Price: are sold at what price
- Place: where is it available
- Promotion: what is the message
all of this is based on [[Market Research]]
