EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes) and EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) are both metrics used to measure a company's profitability.
## EBIT
EBIT is calculated by subtracting interest expense and taxes from a company's net income. It shows a company's operating profit before considering the impact of interest and taxes.

Formula: EBIT = Net Income + Interest Expense + Taxes
## EBITDA
EBITDA is similar to EBIT, but it also adds back depreciation and amortization expenses. This metric is often used in leveraged buyouts or when a company has significant non-operating income or expenses.

Formula: EBITDA = EBIT + Depreciation + Amortization
## Key differences

1. **Depreciation and Amortization:** EBITDA includes these non-cash expenses, whereas EBIT does not.
2. **Cash flow focus:** EBITDA is often used to evaluate a company's cash flow generation capabilities, as it excludes the impact of non-cash items like depreciation and amortization.
3. **Interest expense:** Both metrics exclude interest expense, but EBITDA might be more relevant for companies with high levels of debt.
## In summary

* Use EBIT when you want to focus on a company's operating profitability without considering the impact of non-operating income or expenses.
* Use EBITDA when you want to evaluate a company's cash flow generation capabilities and consider the impact of depreciation, amortization, and other non-cash items.
