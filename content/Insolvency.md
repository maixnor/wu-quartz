- Shift from profit maximization to satisfying liabilities to creditors
	- Shareholders are protected by [[Limited Liability]]
- After [[Liquidation]] the company ceases to exist
- Liquidation is often not the best option
	- Creditors foregoing (parts) of the liabilities after a complete restructure of the company to allow further trading is often more advisable
- If the Liquidation procedure is too expensive (court fees, insolvency administrator, etc) the company is simply deleted from the [[Business Register]] and no further action is taken. The creditors loose their entire invenstment
 
# When am I insolvent?
- not being able to pay the due liabilities
	- second test
- negative equity in the balance sheet
	- first test (easier)
	- but if the company can still operate normally the company is still not insolvent
	- e.g. real estate prices may be far lower in balance sheet than in reality and this difference can be all the difference

# Insolvency Proceedings
- Managers need to file insolvency
	- Creditors can file insolvency as well
- Management looses power to represent and lead the company
### Route Liquidation
- After [[Liquidation]] the funds are split equally according to their share (everyone gets the same percent of their debts back)
	- Some debts have priority, those of the court and the insolvency case in general are payed first
### Route Settlement
- If a settlement cannot be reached the Route Liquidation is taken
- If more than 50% of creditors and more than 50% of debt can agree on a settlement to forego the debt then the company may stay operational, but will be restructured by the administrator
	- at least 20% within 2 years need to be payed back, lower is not possible
	- if company agrees to 30% or more within 2 years even managers may stay in power
		- might be dangerous due to inept or conflicting managers
# Pecking Order
Who receives money in what order. Only when the higher layer is completely satisfied (repayed) then the next lower layer gets some funds as well.
