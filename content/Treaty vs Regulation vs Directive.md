# Treaty:

A treaty is an agreement between two or more sovereign states. In the European Union context, treaties are also referred to as the primary law or primary legislation.
The most significant treaty governing the [[EU]] is the Treaty on European Union ([[TEU]]) and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union ([[TFEU]]). These treaties establish the legal framework of the EU, define its objectives, and allocate powers among its institutions.
# Regulation:

A regulation is a legal act that is directly applicable and binding in its entirety across all [[EU]] member states. This means that once a regulation is adopted, it becomes law in all member states without the need for national legislation.
Regulations are often used for matters that require uniform rules across the [[EU]], such as the regulation of the internal market or the protection of fundamental rights.
# Directive:

A directive is a legal act that sets out a goal that all [[EU]] member states must achieve but allows them flexibility as to how to achieve it. Unlike a regulation, a directive does not have direct effect; it requires implementation by the national authorities through the adoption of national laws or other measures.
Directives are commonly used in areas where the [[EU]] wants to harmonize certain aspects of law while leaving room for adaptation to the specific circumstances of each member state.
# In summary:

**Treaty**: Establishes the foundational principles and structure of the [[EU]].
**Regulation**: Directly applicable and binding in its entirety across all member states.
**Directive**: Sets a goal for member states to achieve but requires national implementation.

Understanding these distinctions is crucial for navigating and interpreting [[EU]] legal texts.
