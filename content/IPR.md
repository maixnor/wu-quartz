IPR (Intellectual Property Rights) refers to a set of legal rights that protect creative works, inventions, and innovations from unauthorized use or exploitation. IPRs include [[patents]], [[trademarks]], [[copyrights]], and trade secrets, which are designed to promote innovation, creativity, and competition by providing exclusive rights to their owners. This allows creators and inventors to benefit financially from their work, while also encouraging others to invest in research and development, leading to new products, services, and ideas that drive economic growth and progress.
# Licensing
IPR (Intellectual Property Rights) Licensing refers to the process of granting permission to use, reproduce, modify, or distribute intellectual property (such as patents, trademarks, copyrights, or trade secrets) owned by an individual or organization.
In this context, licensing means allowing someone else to exploit the IP rights in exchange for a fee, royalties, or other considerations. This can include:

- Licensing patents to manufacture products
- Allowing others to use trademarks or brand names
- Granting permission to reproduce copyrighted materials (e.g., music, literature)
- Sharing trade secrets with partners or collaborators

IPR licensing enables creators and innovators to monetize their intellectual property while also fostering innovation, collaboration, and competition.
