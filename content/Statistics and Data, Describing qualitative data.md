- Science of data

## descriptive statistics
- quantitative vs qualitative data
## inferential statistics
- predictions, estimates of sample data -> stock market
	- confidence intervals
	- hypothesis testing
	- regression analysis

# Definitions
- experimental unit -> what we collect data from
- population -> group of experimental units -> subgroup of all global data
	- e.g. all working adults in Austria
- variable -> characteristic or property in a population
- sample -> a subset of the population (not biased/selected)
	- e.g. the working adults in Austria asked by survey X
- statistical inference -> estimate, prediction, etc on population based on sample
	- e.g. the preference of cola brand based on 1.000 people survey
- measure of reliability -> statement about uncertainty

# Data 
### Qualitative Variables
- cannot be measured in numbers
- nominal variable
	- classification -> e.g. member of religion
	- definitely true with binary data points (yes/no)
- ordinal variable
	- same like nominal variables
	- have an order
	- can be sorted, ranked
		- e.g. course grades

### Quantitative Variables
- continuous, metric variable
- interval variable
	- linear scale of values -> differences between values are meaningful
		- e.g. temperature, time
- ratio variable
	- ratio between 2 values is meaningful 
	- there must be a natural 0 
		- e.g. temperature in Celsius has no natural 0, Calvin does
