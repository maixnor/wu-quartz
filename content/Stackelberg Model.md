# Stackelberg Model
The Stackelberg model is an economic model of industry structure in which a **market leader firm sets its output level first, and follower firms then decide their output levels based on the leader’s decision**.

> [!TLDR] 
> Sequential output decisions
### Assumptions
- One of the **firms sets its output first**
- The **other firm observes** this decision and **sets its own output second**
- **Firm 1 knows that Firm 2 will react** and has to **take that into account when setting its output**.
- **Firm 2 takes the output decision of Firm 1 as given** and **sets its output using the [[Cournot Model#Reaction Function|cournout reaction function]]**.
### Example
Building on „[[Cournot Model#Example Extreme Duopoly]]“ assume that firm 1 decides first on its quantity. Firm 2 observes the decision of firm 1 and decides subsequently (i.e. firm 1 is the Stackelberg-Leader). Calculate the profits of the two firms.

$F_1$ chooses $q_1$, 
then $F_2$ chooses $q_2$
Suppose $F_1$ choose $q_1 \rightarrow q_2(q_1)= (30-q_{1})/ 2$
$F_1$s problem: $(30-q_1-(30-q_1)/2)q_1$ → max $q_2$
$1/2 (30-q_{1})q_{1}$
$30-2q_{1}=0$
$q_{1}^*=15$
$q_{2}^*=7.5$

## First Mover Advantage of the Stackelberg Model
Conclusions for symmetric firms:
- The output of Firm 1 is two times larger than that of Firm 2
- The profit of Firm 1 is two times larger than that of Firm 2 (first mover advantage)

> This is only true for symmetric firms and constant marginal costs!
