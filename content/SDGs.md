# Sustainability Reporting
- voluntary reporting 
- very impact focused
	- some industry-specific stuff, e.g. healthcare
- about 17 goals, 169 targets
	- targets very country-focused

# Problems
- targeted initially for entire countries
- call for action by companies too
	- not mandatory
	- most companies just use the pretty pictures, not necessarily the actual goals
- company can just cherry-pick the SDGs they meet
	- no need to write about which are not met
- some companies are actually using them, very useful there, but only some companies
