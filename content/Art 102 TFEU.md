## Relevant Market
- how to define the relevant market?
	- product market and geographic market
	- product market -> interchangeable products (demand/supply substitutes)
	- geographic market -> geographic reach of company (local to whole Europe)
		- not just where companies are, but also where they could be in 1 year
- [[Market Definition Notice (2024)]] - European Commission
## Dominant Position
- presumed from market shares of 50% ([[AKZO Case]])
	- in very dynamic markets even 80% may not be dominant (e.g. nobody uses Skype anymore)
	- lowest dominant position by market share was 39% -> lower is possible
- other indicators:
	- Economies of scale/scope
	- fixed costs (R&D, marketing)
	- [[IPR]]s
	- structural barriers (digital ecosystems)
	- no countervailing buyer power
## Abusive Behavior
- unfair purchase/selling prices
- limiting production, markets, or technical development
- dissimilar conditions to equivalent transactions

- exploitative abuse vs exclusionary abuse
	- exploit -> let them live and benefit off of their lower market power
	- exclusion -> e.g. predatory pricing -> goal to eliminate competitors
- [[Rebates]]
- [[Tying]] and bunding
- [[Predatory Pricing]]
- refusal to supply & [[Margin Squeeze]]
	- dominant players might be forced to supply everyone
## Cases
