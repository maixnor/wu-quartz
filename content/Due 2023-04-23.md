 Please post your questions/critical remarks relating to:
- Streeck (2005). How are employment relations institutionalized and what is the role of trade unions? (p.260-273)
- Baccaro (2020). Do we need trade unions? (only first 30 mins)

# Streeck
- do unions really fulfill what they set out to do? Since GDP has increased massively (2x) over the past 50 years (adjusted for inflation) the average workers wage has barely increased at all after inflation. Shouldn't workers unions have enough bargaining power to demand this extra productivity at least in part for themselves?
# Baccaro
- Trade Unions I believe to reduce the exploitation of individuals. Since most people are not able to negotiate well they are easily exploited for much lower wages. They also increase information distribution through the means of "advertisement" for their cause
