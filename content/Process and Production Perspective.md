# Optimizations
- Assembly Lines
- first assembly lines in Chicago slaughterhouses
- [[Henry Ford]] applied the concept to building cars
	- [[Division of Labor]]
	- Model T has a revolutionary **production process**
### Brand Specialization
- Red Bull is just marketing and sales company
	- Production and Bottling done by **Rauch**
	- Distribution done by **Logwin**
- allowing for great specialization
- [[Make Or Buy]] -> outsourcing
# Production Theory
### Transformation of goods (old school)
[ inputs ] => [ outputs ]

- e.g. baking many cakes
	- all ingredients + workhours + machine hours
	- = x amount of cakes
- Optimization
	- maximum cakes for the same ingredients
	- same cakes with less ingredients
### Value Chain (newer)
- a lot of costs
	- [[Direct Costs]]
		- logistics, operations, marketing, aftersales
	- [[Indirect Costs]]
		- sourcing
		- [[Research and Development]]
		- [[Human Resources]]
		- Infra (IT, Vehicles, Buildings)
- all costs should be covered by [[Profit#Producer Rent|Producer Rent]] 
# Pipeline vs Platform
- Pipeline by example Netflix
	- buying movies from e.g. Disney
	- producing movie by yourself -> still costs money
	- products are sold
		- selling is done via monthly subscriptions
- Platform by example Youtube
	- movies are supplied by users
	- movies (product) is free for youtube
	- producers (users) need to have incentive
		- ad revenue / publicity for merch sales
	- two-sided market
		- customer and producer
		- platform is middleman
	- often employ [[Vendor Lockin]]
### Smartphone
- the phone is a clear pipeline product
- what is one the phone (apps and service) form a platform
- the real value is not in selling the phone, but selling services via the phone
- the phone (hardware) does not need to change, the software is also part of the value
- [[The Winner Takes It All]] when it comes to platforms -> app stores
	- [[Vendor Lockin]] beneficial here
	- [[Network Effect]] can become extreme here
### Digital vs Physical Platforms
- physical
	- shopping malls have a physical growth limit
- digital
	- almost infinite apps on a phone
