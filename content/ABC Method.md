## Overview
- **Activity-Based Costing (ABC)**
- Allocation of costs to activities
- More accurate product costing

## Key Components
- **Activities**
	- Actions that incur costs (e.g., setup, production)
- **Cost Drivers**
	- Factors that cause costs to increase (e.g., machine hours, labor hours)
- **Cost Pools**
	- Grouping of costs associated with specific activities (e.g. machine hours mapped by electricity bill)

## Steps in ABC
1. Identify activities
2. Assign costs to each activity (cost pools)
3. Determine cost drivers for activities
4. Calculate activity rates (cost per driver unit)
5. Allocate costs to products based on usage of cost drivers

## Advantages
- Greater accuracy in product costing
- Better understanding of overhead costs
- Enhanced decision-making for pricing and budgeting

## Disadvantages
- Complexity in implementation
- Requires detailed data collection
- Higher administrative costs

## Conclusion
- ABC method supports strategic financial management
- Valuable for companies with diverse products and overhead costs
