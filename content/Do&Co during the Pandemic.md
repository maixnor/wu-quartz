@Fuhrmann created a case study about Do&Co during the pandemic and how they recovered. They managed to recover quite well based on share price and profits.

Fields of business:
- Hotels
- Restaurants
- Event Catering
- Airline Catering

All of them were hit by [[Covid]] and therefore their sales decreased drasticly.
