# Background of EU
- Institution built up in the post-WWII situation
    - First aim of European integration was the aim of lasting peace
    - Build up peace by stronger cooperation of member states in Europe
    - Nucleus of peace-building process was to build strong connections between France and Germany
        - WWI, WWII and even before, hostilities between these countries were large
        - This was an issue for all of Europe
    - Cooperation, collaboration
        - Not just in economics but also the longer perspective
        - From the beginning, there was an idea of a political union
    - Other companies joined for the peace and economic benefits
    - Legal aspects
        - Union based on Law
            - Alternative to a union based on power
                - Political power is more difficult to handle
                - Danger to get back into war is much more prevalent through political power
    - After development of european union
        - Based on treaty of Lisbon
            - Considered Constitution of EU
                - Tried to establish an actual constitution but was denied for political reasons
                - Functionally a constitution nonetheless
            - Treaty on European Union TEU
                - A state has to fulfill certain conditions in order to become a member of the EU
                    - Has to comply with all of the EU laws (acquie comminute)
                - Only a country following human rights laws have access
                - (Copenhagen Criteria)
            - Treat on the Functioning of the European Union TFEU
            - When talking about treaties:
                - Who are we talking about
                - Who is involved?
                - International law treaty founding European Union
    - How does a state become a new member?
        - Ukraine, Moldova
            - Process is “on the way”
            - In legal terms: in order for Ukraine to access the union, they must have an accession treaty
                - All other existing member states have to agree on this treaty
                    - It is necessary for **every** member to approve accession of new members
                        - Every member has a different process for how they decide on approving members
            - Process is mean to lead the country to the union
                - The state must be prepared to enter the union because there’s so much EU law that new members have to comply with
                - Must change internal law to comply with **every** EU law
