# Gentle Intro
- Hypothesis 
	- after [[Popper Logic]]
	- every hypothesis has to be able to be disproven
- null-Hypothesis
	- default value (status quo) for a parameter (until proven false)
	- denoted as $H_0$
	- like defendant in court ... unguilty until proven otherwise
- alternative Hypothesis
	- 
	- denoted as $H_a$
### Example Machine
- machine must produce with mean diameter of 0.5 inch
	- $H_{0}: d = 0.5in$
	- $H_{a}: d \neq 0.5 in$
## Testing
- possible outcome of any Test
	- reject the null hypothesis
		- finding a non-white swan (significant result)
	- fail to reject the null hypothesis
		- even tho I fail to reject, I still do not accept the null-Hypothesis
			- there can still be a black swan out there
		- in reality, large enough sample size might result in "inpractical" status 
			- no further research to be done
- rejecting is positive
## Errors
- [[Popper Logic#Errors]]
## Ingredients
- confidence level
	- e.g. 99%
- rejection region
	- defining when $H_0$ is rejected in favor of $H_a$
	- e.g. when arbitrary experiment result is greater than 5
	- rejection region is always outside of confidence interval
- test statistic
	- depends on problem we have
## Interpretation
- when result is inside confidence interval
	- i.e. outside the rejection region
	- we know that we cannot reject $H_0$, but still not accept it
	- at the current confidence level
