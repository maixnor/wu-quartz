## General
- not yet implemented in Austria, deadline 6.7.2024 (already passed)
	- implementation till 1.1.2025 questionable -> [[#Sanctions/Further Deadlines]]
- replaces the [[NFRD]] in essence
	- [[NFRD]] still mandatory for large companies
- applies within [[EU]]
	- applies to all subsidiaries, even if not in EU
	- parent companies which are not in EU are exempted
- transposition: NaBeG

- how to look up which member states have implemented a directive
	- eur-lex.europa.eu
	- under national transposition there is a list of implemetations 

## Reporting Changes
- uniform EU-Standards [[ESRS]] 
	- [[directive]] needs to be implemented into domestic laws
- increases requirements for disclosure
	- now part of Management Report
	- must be in digital and in machine readable format
		- same as Financial Statement 
		- [[Digital Tagging]]
- have to comply in contrast to [[NFRD]]
	- no explanations anymore, qualitative/quantitative data
- environment, social, governance covered

- concept of [[Double Materiality]]
	- related to [[EU Taxonomy Regulation]]

## Assurance
- mandatory [[limited assurance]] (later reasonable) by a statutory auditor or an independent assurance services proveder ([[IASP]])
	- once [[reasonable assurance]] kicks in the pressure will increase
		- mostly about auditing firms, they cannot yet provide this service
		- liabilities are too high
	- check for completeness, rather than correctness
	- a huge business in auditing companies
		- no separate departments currently
		- EY Austria acquired sustainability reporting auditing firms, others in the [[The Big 4]] do the same

## Sanctions/Further Deadlines
- possibility of high sanctions
	- since alignment with financial reporting sanctions (which are very strict)
- Case A - implementation before 1.1.2025
	- in full accordance with [[ESRS]]
- Case B - implementation before 30.4.2025
	- [[ESRS]] is mandatory, [[EU]] still happy
- Case C - implementation after 30.4.2025
	- only [[NaDiVeG]]/[[NFRD]] mandatory, [[EU]] may issue sanctions
