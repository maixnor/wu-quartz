# Industrial Revolution ... Again
- [[Script 2 Summary#Great Divergence]]
- factory system 
- new energy sources - fossit fuels
	- mills, railways, steam ships
- higher growth rate -> especially in [[GDP]]
- revolution ... quick, sudden, violent change
	- ind. rev. took 60-70 years, not so quick
	- but economy changed forever -> violent
		- social and cultural
		- "culture of growth"
		- political and institutional changes
- **no large country has developed without (some) industrialization**

# Indicators of change
- decline in agriculture and textiles (primary sector)
	- growth in clothes (and other secondary sectors)
	- growth in tertiary sector
- total output and labor productivity of factories rising quickly
	- enables increases in building, transport, transaction (finance) sectors
	- services productivity increase was slower than industry growth
		- still considerable volume increase, just not productivity increase
	- cotton greatest relative growth

# Productivity/Efficiency Growth
- [[Cobb-Douglas Production Function]]
	- large population growth -> large labor increase
	- capital per worker only grew after ind. rev., not during
		- land per worker decreased
	- increased education for higher productivity factor
- "age of improvement"
- e.g. cost of cotton yarn fell from 9$ to 0.4$
- reduced coal consumption due to technical innovation with steam engines
	- consumption of coal:
		- 49% mines, 21% textiles, 12% metal, ...
- steam engines in more machines (e.g. locomotive/ships)
- exponential rise in coal energy consumption per capita
- best suited for basic resources and simple products
	- cotton, linen, wool, iron, buttons, nails

## Benefits of Factory System
- central location for workers/sources of power
- [[Economy of Scale]] and serial production
- separation worker and owners (capital formed)
- separation home and firm (production and consumption)
- discipline ("time is money")
- subdivision -> unspecialized workers (women, children)
- [[Marx Alienation]]

# Why Britain?
## Factors

### Obvious Factors
- geography
	- island with many rivers
		- water transport cheaper than on land before railway 
- market integration
	- division of labor
	- colonialism
	- export to colonies
- institutions and politics
	- centralized government, rule of law
	- patent protection, property rights, pro-market politics
- demography
	- not too fast population growth -> [[Script 2 Summary#Malthusian Theory or Trap|Malthusian]]
- agriculture
	- increasing efficiency prior to ind. rev. -> specialization, urbanization
	- dissolution of feudalism -> market integration, institutions

### Less Obvious Factors
- social changes
	- income oriented vs status oriented
	- protestant reformation -> success of earth > afterlife
	- rational decision-making
- intellectual changes
	- elite knowledge
- per capita incomes
	- already wealthy/productive before ind. rev.
		- domestic market orientation, colonies -> jobs, ports, imports
	- better nutrition/health -> better physical work ability

## Explanations

### Institutions - Property Rights
- [[glorious revolution]]
	- budget right
	- better material and intellectual property rights -> "private property"
	- rich people can lend money to government -> [[Bond]]
		- investments less risky and more likely -> more credit
	- lower transactions cost, better financial markets
	- contra-argument to financial markets:
		- relatively bad financial setup for ind. rev.
		- [[Limited Liability]] was seen as problematic
- patent registrations took off after 1760
	- evidence mixed
		- many key inventions not patented
		- many patents worthless -> taking to court difficult
	- indicator for innovation seeking of time

### Demand-Side explanation
- by [[Jan de Vries]]
	- actual "revolution" even before ind. rev.
	- people worked more and harder (also women, children)
		- marked-oriented production
	- greater interest in consumption than in leisure
- new goods (sugar, coffee, tea)
	- also furniture, clocks, pottery, ironware, books

### Induced Innovation - Labor replaced by Capital and Energy
- labor became more expensive
	- incentive for labor-saving machines
	- very cheap energy cost
	- higher income -> better education -> more/better inventions
	- higher income -> better nutrition -> better work output

### Culture of Growth - social status and enlightenment
- culture of "growth" and "progress"
- scientific revolution
	- pan-european, not just biritish
	- "Knowledge is power" -> overcome [[poverty]]
- incentives to innovate > directed inventions
	- reputation for engineers, patents, prestige > population size
	- "tweakers" and "tinkers" - people that could fix and work on machines
		- innovation by chance, not by deliberate action

# Consequences of Ind. Rev.
- separation of production and consumption
- urbanization and factory towns at first a planning disaster
	- economic [[Inequality]], agriculture seen as "backside" of country
- [[Script 2 Summary#Great Divergence|Great Divergence]] as global problem
- [[Climate Change]]
	- due to increased transport and fossile fuels used (especially coal in beginning)

## Energy as Production Factor
- energy (or coal) can be seen in land and capital sense
	- land ... subterranean forest adding value
	- capital ... coals needs to be paid for
- how to verify? [[Elasticity]] between output factor and coal price / coal availability
	- conclusion: not fully substituteable (coal is not a dependent factor if no steam engine is involved)
	- different measurements:
