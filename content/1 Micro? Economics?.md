# What dis?
- Economics ... management of scarce resources
- Microeconomics ... management of scarce resources of individuals, households, firms

## Supply and Demand, Again
- [[Supply And Demand]] created
## Elasticity of Demand
- [[Supply And Demand#Price Elasticity]]

- elastic: $|E| > 1$ ... demand does scale
- 1-elastic: $|E| = 1$ ... rare
- inelastic: $|E| < 1$ ... demand does not scale 

- Income Elasticity
	- inferior good $E_I < 0$
	- normal good $E_I < 0$
- Cross Price Elasticity
	- substitutes: $E_{q1, p2} > 0$
	- complements: $E_{q1, p2} < 0$

> the flatter the demand curve, the more elasticity

### Problem of Monopoly
- where to place your price?
- if price is too high ... high elasticity ... very low demand
- if price is too low ... low elasticity ... little profit

### Extremes
- completely inelastic
	- crucial drugs/medicine -> any price you have to pay
- completely elastic
	- something which was free is now pay -> nobody will pay

### Short vs Long Term Elasticity
- elasticity of electricity
	- short term -> almost impossible to change the consumption habits
	- long term -> possible to change e.g. buying more energy efficient washing machine


# Glossary
- Complements ... when products are bound together
	- when demand for cars decreases, such will the demand for car tires
- Substitutes ... when products are interchangeable 
	- apple vs samsung - can have just one phone
- market clearing price ... demand = supply
