## Principal vs Agent
for reference: [[Principal-Agent Conflicts]]
- taking a closer look at [[Principal-Agent Conflicts#Shareholders and Management]]

## Structures
- board of directors is making decisions
	- may also include external contractors or independant directors, typically less knowledgeable than executive directors
- day-to-day business handled by managers
	- top-manager sometimes also part of board of directors
- codetermination
- one tier structure
	- just a board of directors with monitoring by employees
	- popular in US, Switzerland, Japan
 - two tier structure
	- board of directors + supervisory board
	- supervisory board monitors the board of directors and managers
	- board of directors and supervisory board may not share members
		- different rules for directors who have retired recently
	- popular in Austria, Germany, Italy
	- supervisory board consists of "voted" people
		- based on jurisdiction votes may be cast from employees, shareholders or both
		- at a certain size and free float there should also be an independent director not affiliated with any major shareholder to represent the minority shareholders

### A word on Independence
- easy to declare, hard to proof
- not measurable, internal state of mind
- one can just exclude e.g. family members and hope for the best

### Board Structure of Austrian AG
- board of directors ... Vorstand
	- members appointed by board of supervision
- board of supervision ... Aufsichtsrat (3-20 people)
- works countil ... Betriebsrat 
	- 1 person for every 2 persons in board of supervision
	- members must be employees, not from a trade union
- both boards consist typically several people

### Board Structure of Austrian GmbH
- just directors and members
	- typically fewer people, therefore less complexity needed
- statutes may require board of supervision
	- again 2:1 ratio of employees
	- does not appoint members of board of directors, there is none
- mandatory in 2 cases
	- > 50 people && > 70k capital (rare)
	- > 300 people average (simpler terms, captures essense)

### Board Structure of Societas Europaea
- both one-tier and two-tier model are possible

## Management and Third Parties
### Representation
- representation is with directors
- forming contracts, buying/selling individual assets etc
- not: selling all assets, merging companies together, etc

### Third Party contracts
- if contract is signed prematurely (e.g. without consent of board of supervisors) then the contract is not valid
	- protecting business deals from mistakes 
	- does not apply when other party signs contract under this knowledge

### Transparency
- who is or isnt director: [[Business Register]]
- plurality of directors: forming binding decisions
	- individually (great flexibility, greatest danger)
	- all of them together (less flexibility, least danger)
	- any two/three/etc of them 
- default rule: all directors together for contract to be binding
- agency law ... representation by employees
	- e.g. signing phone contract, not done by director
- attribution
	- faults of directors (negative action or inaction) can always be attributed to the company
	- a company "knows" something when a director knows of it

## Appointment and Removal of Board Members
#todo page 63 onwards

## Running the Company
- managers cannot restructure company on their own -> shareholder approval
	- 3/4 majority
	- increase equity
	- merger / split
- private limited company
	- crucial decisions need to be made with all members
	- status define these decisions
	- contracts made without consent to a 3rd party are still binding
		- consequences are beared by director responsible
	- members can give instructions when a majority is reached
		- members can take initiative
	- position of members is strong
- public limited company
	- no instructions from members -> managerial independence
		- buffer against majority shareholders wants
		- most still comply with majority, otherwise 'no confidence' in next shareholder meeting
	- shareholders need only be consulted for merger
	- board of supervisors consulted for material changes (closing a plant)
	- board of supervisors can only prohibit things, not take initiative
		- still, since supervisors can remove directors, they are likely to comply when asked 
	- contracts made without consent to a 3rd party are still binding
		- consequences are beared by director responsible
### Remuneration
- GmbH
	- executive compensation -> even if no profits
	- dividends -> only if profits
- AG
	- shareholders have "say on pay", decide on model
- remuneration -> tool to align managers
	- instead of extensive monitoring
	- cash payments or stock options programme
- board of supervision
	- typically no performance compensation
	- fixed compensation
	- different alignment to management needed

- different directors, different responsibilities
	- CFO -> finance
- board of supervisors
	- decisions in circular resolution (majority vote) or in meeting
	- provided with reports
- committees
	- decisions delegated to board of supervisors
	- accounting auditing

## Liability
- compensation
	- incentive to not inflict damage
	- not liable for lack of success
	- only liable for negligent actions (or inactions)
	- liable if violate specific duties
		- duty of loyalty (don't compete)
		- duty of care (standards for management)
			- [[hindsight bias]] by judges -> less risky decisions
		- protection via D&O liability insurance
- lawsuit against company
	- AG -> board of supervisors
	- GmbH -> members
	- shareholders -> rarely, not enough knowledge
				
- damage by company vs damage by 3rd party
- damage to company -> damage to shareholders

### Internal Decision-Making Process
- public: majority vote, CEO's vote counts double if inconclusive
- private: all directors need to approve
