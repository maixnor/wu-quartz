# Same same, but different
- last one was consumer taking care of needs
	- demand given
- this one is suppliers and how they take actions and decisions
	- supply given

# 3 Steps
- revenue expectations
	- demand
	- competition -> lower prices
- cost constraints
	- technology -> different combinations of inputs produce same output
	- efficiency -> choosing least cost to produce same output
	- input cost -> revenue must be higher than production cost -> profit
- output choices
	- what to do with profits?

## Production Technology
- production function
	- shows highest output possible (not efficiently)
	- maps the equilibrium prices of inputs and outputs
	- $Q = F(K, L)$ output = F( capital , labor )
		- [[Marginal Changes]] in Labor and Capital interesting
### Short Term Production 
- short term != short term -> depends on business
- Production with one variable input
	- certain inputs cannot be adjusted fast e.g. expert machinery
- Law of [[Diminishing Marginal Returns]]
