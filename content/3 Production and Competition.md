# Same same, but different
- last one was consumer taking care of needs
	- demand given
- this one is suppliers and how they take actions and decisions
	- supply given

# 3 Steps
- revenue expectations
	- demand
	- competition -> lower prices
- cost constraints
	- technology -> different combinations of inputs produce same output
	- efficiency -> choosing least cost to produce same output
	- input cost -> revenue must be higher than production cost -> profit
- output choices
	- what to do with profits?

## Production Technology
- production function
	- shows highest output possible (not efficiently)
	- maps the equilibrium prices of inputs and outputs
	- $Q = F(K, L)$ output = F( capital , labor )
		- [[Marginal Changes]] in Labor and Capital interesting
### Short Term Production 
- short term != short term -> depends on business
- Production with one variable input
	- certain inputs cannot be adjusted fast e.g. expert machinery
	- Law of [[Diminishing Marginal Returns]]

### Long Term Production
- all production inputs can be adjusted -> multi-variable
- Production with two variable input
	- different combinations of capital and labor can yield same output -> [[Substitution]]
	- [[Isoquant]] -> all combinations of input which yield the same output 
	- Marginal Rate of Technical Sustitution
		- MRTS -> [[Diminishing Marginal Returns]] for each Isoquant
		- how much can capital substitute labor and vice versa
	- special case: inputs are perfect substitutes
		- Isoquants are linear -> any combination of capital and labor feasible
	- special case: inputs cannot be substituted
		- Isoquants are L shaped -> precise mapping of capital and labor

### Returns to Scale
- scaling inputs and outputs equally -> both 2x
- how much is the output going to change -> 1x? 1.5x? 2x? 3x? 10x?
	- 2x -> constant returns to scale
	- <2x -> decreasing returns to scale
	- >2x -> increasing returns to scale
- if returns to scale is 
	- increasing then a monopoly is beneficial for society
	- decreasing then a split into many small companies is beneficial for society
- $F(L,K) = A*L^{\alpha}*K^{\beta}$
- scaling by factor $\lambda > 1$ : $F(\lambda L, \lambda K) = \lambda^{\alpha + \beta} * F(L,K)$
	- [[Cobb-Douglas Production Function]]

## Production Costs
- cost function
	- cost minimization for given
	- linear (simple models) or convex ($x^2$)
- $C = w * L +  r * K$ 
	- Cost = wages * labor + rent rate * capital
- economic cost != accounting cost
	- economic cost -> cost of utilizing resources in production
	- [[Opportunity Cost]] very relevant
	- [[Past Sunk Cost]] irrelevant -> not human-like behavior
- fixed costs vs variable costs
	- marginal costs -> how much one more unit in output will cost
	- average costs -> amount produced / total cost

### Short Term
- capital and output level is fixed
	- calculating labor level which satisfies the desired output level
- no substitution whatsoever
- marginal cost vs marginal product of labor

### Long Term
- 

## Maximum Profit
- Marginal Revenue = Marginal Costs
