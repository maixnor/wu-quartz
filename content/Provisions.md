- liability without certain timing or amount
- obligation
	- legal ... self explanatory
	- constructive -> common with car manufacturers (warranty), web stores with routine return policies
- probably going to happen (high probability)
- must be related to a past event
- reliable estimate -> otherwise [[Contingent Liability]]
- current provisions -> expected next year
	- otherwise non-current provisions (more than 1 year)
- always to a third party (employees, customers, other companies)

- lower Taxes 
- more Cash stays on Cash Accounts 
## Account Movements
- provision registered with 100
	- [[Profit and Loss Statement|PL]] decreases by 100 !!!!
	- [[Balance Sheet|BS]] + 100 liabilities
		- liability why? 
			- this money can never leave the company
			- no mention in which asset class
	- operating CF is not affected !!!
- provision resolved with 110 (more than expected)
	- [[Balance Sheet|BS]] - 100 liabilities | - 110 cash
	- [[Profit and Loss Statement|PL]] - 10
	- operating CF - 110
		- - 10 already included from PL !!!
		- - 100 always booked directly
- provision resolved with 80 (less than expected)
	- [[Balance Sheet|BS]] - 100 liabilities | - 80 cash
	- [[Profit and Loss Statement|PL]] + 20
	- operating CF - 80
		- + 20 already included from PL !!!
		- - 100 always booked directly
