- starting from the conclusions and working backwards through the decision tree to find the resulting decision
	- conclusions ... trade-offs at end of branches (leaves)
- allows to filter out clearly bad outcomes and maybe rule out entire decision paths entirely (especially with more complex decision trees)
- computationally expensive 
	- grows exponentially with choices and depth
