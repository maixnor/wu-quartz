# Bundling
- selling multiple products as a package
- pure bundling: products only available as a bundle
- mixed bundling: products cheaper in bundle than individually

- heterogeneous consumers
- price discrimination not allowed
- different reservation price
	- negative correlation of demand curve

- example: phone contract
### Individual Pricing
- set price at maximum value of lowest willingness to pay
	- anything below leaves out profits from same consumers
	- anything above limits the consumer range
### Pure Bundling
- set bundle price to willingness to pay of both products
	- sell to more people -> more products sold
- mostly better with largely imperfect negative correlation
	- i.e. total willingness to pay is widely different across consumers
### Mixed Bundling
- requires close to perfect negative correlation of demand curves
- easiest is to price the bundle as the sum of both products willingness to pay
- set bundle value same as pure bundling
- set individual price to maximum outlier price
	- how wide the outlier range is depends on the case
- calculation wise a difficult problem
	- has only been solved in the last 10 years
