# Principle
- working capital = current assets - current liabilities
- working capital -> money which is not resulting in long-term profits
	- current assets are used to build and sustain revenue
	- long term profits come from non-current assets
		- e.g. new machines -> cheaper production -> larger margin
## Too High Working Capital
- might be too much Inventory -> hard to sell
- many firms are trying to reduce their working capital
# Working Capital Cycle
## Balance Sheet and P/L
- Buy Resources (+20 inventory, +20 liabilities)
	- work-in-progress and finished goods 
- Produce Products (+15 inventory, -15 cash)
- Sales -> Receivables (+50 receivables, -35 inventory, +15 retained earnings)
	-  P/L (Sales +50, Cost of Goods Sold -35 = 15 Profit)
- Receivables -> Cash Flow (+50 cash, -50 receivables) (P/L 0)
- Cash Flow -> paying Payables (-20 cash, -20 liabilities)
- Produce or Buy Inventory -> circle continues
## Same with Cash Flow
- start with EBT: +15
- - increase in inventory: -20
- + increase in liabilities: +20
- - spending in production: -15 <- actual cash flow
- + reduction in inventory: +35
- - increase in receivables: -50
- until here sum is 0 -> no cash has flown yet
- + decrease in receivables: +50 <- actual cash flow
- - decrease in liability: -20 <- actual cash flow
- = +15 -> positive cash flow
