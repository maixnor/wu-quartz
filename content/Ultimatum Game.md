The subjects are paired

One subject gets 100 Bucks, this subject may share some money with the other subject.

If the other subject accepts the split, it will happen. If the other subject declines, then the deal breaks and both subjects get nothing.

Game theory: Any offer should be accepted, because even 1 Buck is better than 0 Bucks

Strategy of Subject 1: 
- Offer the minimum amount
- Subject 2 accepts offer and gets minimum amount
- Subject 1 gets maximum amount

In the lab: a lot of rejections
