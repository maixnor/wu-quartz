# Types of Motivation

## Intrinsic Motivation
- inner feelings
	- sports -> just feels nice

## Extrinsic Motivation
- doing something for the reward
	- studying slides to get a good grade
- doing something for fearing punishment
	- parking somewhere else to not get a ticket

## Complementary
- sometimes both intrinsic and extrinsic are needed to get the job done
- starting is mostly extrinsic motivation
- keep doing is mostly intrinsic motivation

## Counteracting
- being forced
	- extrinsic motivation killing intrinsic motivation
