## Triangular Relationship
- [[Financial Statement]]
- [[Balance Sheet]]
- [[Cash Flow Statement]] or [[Profit and Loss Statement]]

## Equity
- Covering losses
- What owners and stock holders have contributed

## Exceptions to triangular relationships
- [[Trirangular Relationship]]

- [[Depreciation]], not in [[Cash Flow Statement]]
- [[Non-Cash Transactions|non-cash]] changes in provisions ... Rückstellung
	- pension schemes (after 10 years)
- "dirty" changes to equity i.e. booked directly into equity
## Value of Assets in Balance Sheet
- only in balance sheet the value of purchase
- not market value
### Fair Value
- Market value may be used
- Cause of [[Financial Crisis 2008]]
  - Inflation of [[Balance Sheet]]
  - When sold at less than book value depreciation kills the company if severe enough

## Financial Accounting
- How are things right now?
- Published to stakeholders and government bodies

## Managerial Accounting
- Why are things like they are
- Not published -> Secrets are in there

## finance analysis
- FTX Crash due to no finance people being present in the company

## Ratios
- e.g. EBIT
- information condensed into simple values
- better to compare business models instead of ratios
- seasonality (compare peak to peak, etc)
- [[Performance Measurement Systems]]
- communicate which ratios are used to assess performance -> mitigating Communication Problems
- projections are not predictions
- Benchmarks, Benchmarks, Benchmarks
  - industry leaders
  - past 10 years
  - other competitors

### Supplier Loans
- hard time paying suppliers during peak times (seasonal)
- giving out a better/later payment scheme
- collect some 2% extra (reverse [[Skonto]]) (cheaper than bank) 
- profit

### Short Term Liquidity
- Working Capital - Money on the move
- One cannot calculate with these funds, Inventories, Interesting with Production Companies

### Long Term Solvency
- all funds company has access to
- also loans and other outside capital

### Profitability Ratios
- return on sales i.e. double sales should lead to double profit
	- reaction: look at cost analysis, don't fire people
	- why is it? Not only: how is it?
- ROI
	- when is my investment amortized

## Cash Conversion Cycle
- measurement of money on the move
- 3 parts
- DSO = Days Sales stays outstanding
	- how long to collect the money from their customers
- DIO = Days Inventory stays outstanding
	- how long to sell inventory
- DPO = Days Payables stays outstanding
	- how long to pay for liabilities 
- CCCs
	- DSO + DIO + DPO

CCC can also be negative 
  -> enormous pressure from large suppliers with huge payment Windows
  -> ethical questions with extreme cost cutting in e.g. Fashion Branche
  -> pre-orders: using the customers money to finance the activity 

Performance is contextual.
