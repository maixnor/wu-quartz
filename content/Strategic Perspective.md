### What is Strategy?

> How to avoid competition

- Rumble in the Jungle 1974
	- World Boxing championship
	- Muhammad Ali and George Foreman 
	- Muhammad Ali banned bc of Vietnam War and Black Rights
	- Muhammad Ali not in his peak performance


> Float like a butterfly - Sting like a bee

&amp; Muhammad Ali

Muhammad Ali's Strategy was to tire George Foreman so much, that in the end he could defeat George Foreman. He was applying his strengths while protecting against his weaknesses. Based on this strategy he trained to support his strategy.

## Strategies
### Price Leadership
providing the same product for a much cheaper price
[[USP]]: the cheapest option
### Product Innovation
being the "original" or the first on the market
[[USP]]: the first product or only product for some time
### Quality Leadership
the brand or the quality of the product is unique enough to create value 
[[USP]]: best product / provides most value
### Niche Leadership
such a "small" market that nobody else wants to participate
[[USP]]: only product available
## Market Barriers
### Market Saturation Barrier
- A saturated market is harder to join in on
- Competitors can still join in markets which are not as separated
	- Red Bull in EU market
	- Monster in US market
### Initial Investment Barrier
- a high investment for any competitors to build up a brand similar to the original
### Innovation Barrier
- it is just too hard to join the race because the innovation costs are so high
	- Apple with its M2 chips
### Patent Barrier
- you can't use my technology or I'll sue you
	- pharma is big with patents
## Market-Based View
- from [[Michael Porter]] (Harvard)
- product oriented
- [[Competitive Advantage]]
	- choose an attractive market
	- establish [[#Market Barriers]] -> me no like competition
-  Multiple brands for multiple markets
- Volkswagen
	- normal Golf -> low price
	- Lamborghini -> brand
	- Porsche -> quality
## Resource-Based View
- from [[Edith Penrose]]
- [[factor]] oriented
- competitive edge being unique access to resources
- they need to be [[VRIO Resources]]
- what about basic resources?
	- Apples -> every apple is mostly the same
		- Organic Farming
		- Special Breeds (maybe old/forgotten breeds)
		- Special Marketing (CO2-free Apples)
## Personal Career Strategy
> University is not about what you get taught. It's about what you learn about yourself.

&amp; [[Speckbacher]]

- personal Strengths and Weaknesses -> [[#Resource-Based View]]
	- what am I good at?
	- what can I improve?
- personal Opportunities and Threats -> [[#Market-Based View]]
	- what is demanded on the job market?
	- what is an attractive job market for me?

Travel, do internships, talk with people, find out what people need/want.

> Focus on your strengths, don't worry about your weaknesses.

do a [[SWOT Analysis]] on yourself

## BCG Portfolio

- Relative market share = $\frac{\text{own market share}}{\text{market share of strongest competitor}}$
- Market Growth = #todo get from slides

| x                  | Relative Market Share Low | Relative Market Share High |
| ------------------ | ------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| High Market Growth | Question Mark            | Star                     |
| Low Market Growth  | Poor Dog                  | Cash Cow                           |

- Poor Dog
	- just don't bother anymore
- Question Mark
	- cash flow alone not sustainable
	- either invest or divest
- Star
	- high cash flow - high costs
	- cash flow sustainable for itself and investments
	- invest or hold
- Cash Cow
	- high cash flow - low costs
	- harvest for as long as possible

### Accounting Perspective
[[BCG Portfolio]] focuses on cash flow

- excess cash flows
	- invest into innovation
	- return to shareholders
- uncontrolled use of finance by managers
- pecking order model of finance: internal -> debt -> equity
- internal capital vs external capital
	- internal capital can be used in ANY way
	- for external capital to be used one needs to ask the investors
- finance and innovation
	- highly innovative ideas funded by equity/debt/internal sources
