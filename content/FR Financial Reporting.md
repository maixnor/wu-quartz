# Why IFRS?
- [[IFRS]]

> Financial Reporting is about creating a basis for investors to predict the future.

## Consolidated Statements
- group consists of: 1 parent company, 2 subsidiaries
- 3 individual financial statements of each (1 + 2)
- 1 economic entity financial statement -> relevant statement
	- combination of the entire group
- same rules as individual statement
	- treated as if it was just 1 giant company
	- all internal transfers are ignored -> [[Intra Group Transactions]]
### Internationality
- group consists of: 1 parent company, 3 subsidiaries in 3 countries
- each individual subsidiary (and parent) must issue individual **local** statements
- group must issue IFRS compliant statement
	- local statements translated to IFRS
	- adding up translated statements

## Why not complete IFRS in Austria?
- IFRS is not democratically created -> 14 expert individuals
	- in Austria not constitutional
- Tax Law is something deliberately not international
- conflict of insterest
