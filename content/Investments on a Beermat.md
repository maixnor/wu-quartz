## How to make a wise decision
- machine lifetime -> [[Depreciation]]
- consider opportunity costs of investment -> interest in slides of week 3
- 2 different machines with different life times (10 vs 8 years)
	 - what happens when the 8 year machine is out of support?
	 - do you buy a new one (add to calculations)?
	 - do you use the old machine?
	 - do you stop production?
- if you are not sure about an outcome assume the most negative one
	- e.g. machine is not worth anything after its lifespan
- [[Amortization]] is important

## But there is not a single solution...
- it depends...
- what strategy is the company following?
	- cash method: [[Discounting]], [[Net Present Value]]
	- annuity method: #todo get from slides
	- [[Internal Rate of Return]]: [[Newtons Approximation]] 
		- rather not use this model, it tends to be misleading
- [[Amortization#Dynamic Amortization]]
- [[Raising Capital]]
- [[Security]]
