# Why IFRS?
- [[IFRS]]

> Financial Reporting is about creating a basis for investors to predict the future.

## Consolidated Statements
- group consists of: 1 parent company, 2 subsidiaries
- 3 individual financial statements of each (1 + 2)
- 1 economic entity financial statement -> relevant statement
	- combination of the entire group
- same rules as individual statement
	- treated as if it was just 1 giant company
	- all internal transfers are ignored -> [[Intra Group Transactions]]
### Internationality
- group consists of: 1 parent company, 3 subsidiaries in 3 countries
- each individual subsidiary (and parent) must issue individual **local** statements
- group must issue IFRS compliant statement
	- local statements translated to IFRS
	- adding up translated statements

## Why not complete IFRS in Austria?
- IFRS is not democratically created -> 14 expert individuals
	- in Austria not constitutional
- Tax Law is something deliberately not international
- conflict of insterest

# Accounting Traditions
## Anglo Saxon (USA) 
- shareholder oriented -> geared towards
- aims to create a stable profit for stable profit distribution
## European 
- tax and creditor oriented
- governments regulating the economy
- tax link -> profit is very hardly linked to tax base


# General Notes
- in Austria (and Germany) only Operating Profit (from [[Profit and Loss Statement]]) may be distributed -> [[Dividend]]
- Dividends between companies are tax free -> would be taxed multiple times then
	- personal Dividend receivables are not tax-free
	- 27.5% withheld at source -> company deducts amount before sending it to you
- Amazon has a very specific quote in it's annual report: when having the choice between showing profit and saving on tax they will choose saving on tax
- Distribution of Profits (dividends)
	- Profit and Loss is not effected -> no tax deduction
	- after decision: + liability, - profit in equity
	- after payout: - liability, - cash
	- liability cancels out in final balance sheet
- Alteration of Balance Sheet or other financial reports is a criminal offense
- Issuance of Shares: + equity, + cash
	- in/decrease of shares: not effecting the balance sheet
	- only important if new shares will be issuance
