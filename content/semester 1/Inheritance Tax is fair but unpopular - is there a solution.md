> Death is the most convenient time to tax rich people

&amp; [[David Lloyd George]]

- UK
	- just 5 % pay inheritance tax
	- up to 1m pounds may be transferred tax free
	- no tax below 325,000 individual or 650,000 couple income
	- gross unequal distribution in wealth and income
	- "land of the baronet and the banker, the aristocrat and the asset stripper"
	- worst of capitalism combined with worst of feudalism
	- equality of opportunity? what this?
- US
	- [[George W Bush]] wanted to reduce the inheritance tax until it was temporarily dropped in 2010
	- [[Donald Trump]] doubled paying threshold (5.5M$ -> 11.2M$)

> One would not choose the 2020 Olympic team “by picking the eldest sons of the gold-medal winners in the 2000 Olympics”. 

&amp; [[Warren Buffet]] -> would lead to "wealth aristocracy"

- half of European Billionaires inherited their wealth

### Solution? Lifetime gift tax
- all gifts 7 years before death are tax-free
- within 7 years only above 125,000 will be taxed like normal income
- means of avoidance
	- agricultural land
	- unquoted business assets
	- earlier transfer of assets
- not a "death tax" anymore, since receivers are taxed
	- Ireland has this: 33% above 320,000 transfer
