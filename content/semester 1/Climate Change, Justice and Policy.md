# Outline
- Ecological Crises
- Economy and the Environment
- Climate Action: [[COP]]1-18
- Social Justice and Environment
- Provisioning Systems

# Climate Change
![[Climate Change#Definition]]

### Humans
- global CO2 concentration has risen drastically due to human development
	- troughs because of ice-times 
	- spikes during warmer times
#wontfix get graph from slides
- Annual CO2 emmissions by world region
- Temperatures have been rising very quickly

### Planetary boundaries
#wontfix get graph from slides
- essential for sustainable human development
- 6 out of 9 boundaries crossed
- multiple interconnected ecological crises

# Environment and Economics?
> What if we define 'the economy' as 'the way we take care of one another'? since that's what it ultimately is.

&amp; [[David Graeber]] 2020

- Environmental Economics
	- thinking in trade-offs
	- 3 pillars
		- environment
		- society
		- economy
	- each pillar is sovereign
- Ecological Economics
	- thinking in priorities
	- 3 layers
		- environment
		- society
		- economy
	- each layer cannot exist without the previous one 
		- everything in economy needs to be good for society 
		- everything in society has to be good for environment

- Scarce, but regenerating, resources can be rotted out
	- example: overfishing
	- previous limiting factor: human capital
		- human capital: boats
	- current limiting factor: natural capital
		- natural capital: fish in the ocean

# Social Justice and Environment
> The winners decide who has committed war crimes

&amp; How war crimes work

- The ones in power will always be more wealthy because they can bend the rules to fit their personal matters
- Politics shape social justice
- potential vicious circle
	- Inequality inequality hinder environmental protection
	- environmental policies and cause inequality

- inequality across borders
	- national lens inadequate
	- multinational corporations need to be controlled
- rich countries need to lead by example
### Inequalities
- exposure and access inequalities
	- distribution of env quality
- policy effect inequalities
	- income effec
- impact inequalities
	- rich vs poor
- policy-making inequality
	- #wontfix slides

- Carbon inequality as pointed out in [[Tackling climate breakdown and delivering economic justice must go hand in hand|this paper]]. Top 10% of income pollute 50%
- total per capita emissions
	- #wontfix get from slides

# Social Thresholds
- Doughnut economics 
	- #wontfix get from slides
- diminishing returns between resource use and social performance
	- aim should be for **sufficiency**
	- more is not always better

- Sufficiency in practice
	- [[Human Need Theory]]
- linking resource use to social outcomes
- science of social provisioning #wontfix grab source from slides

### Provisioning
- goods need to be produced, distributed, utilized
- physical elements
	- infrastructure
	- tech
	- land use
- social elements
	- instituations (markets, states)
- #wontfix continue from slides 41

### Universal Basic Services
- example: free public transport
- aims
	- equity
	- efficiency
	- solidarity
	- sustainability

# Takeaways
- inequality crises as ecological crises
- responsibility for change lies within the ones in power (politics and government)
- inequality is an environmental problem
- human needs theory instead of value (market based) theory
- social justice just as important as environmental solutions
- social justice and sustainability are 2 faces of same coin
