Ultra-Simplification of Reality

2 different products (ice crean & shoes, potatoes & meat)

The curve signals the maximum amount of goods you can produce with the amount of resources (labor, capital, land, knowledge). The resources stay constant. Decision on how much of which I want to produce.

A great visualization of scarcity. 

A point:
 - on the curve: efficient
 - inside the curve: not efficient
 - outside the curve: unattainable

Shape of the curve:
how much do I have to sacrifice in my current product, so that I can produce 1 more unit of the other product
- straight
	- sacrifice stays constant (1:1)
- convex (outward)
	- products profit from being produced together
- concave (inward)
	- products do not profit from being produced together
