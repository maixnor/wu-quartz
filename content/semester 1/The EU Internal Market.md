Relevant Cases to know are the ones with their own links or which are mentioned in the [[Questions GLE - post Midterm]] page.
-> [[Stoss Case]], [[Dassonville Case]], [[Keck Case]], [[Cassis de Dijon Case]]

## The Internal Market as the Centre of Gravity of EU Integration
- [[EPC]]
- [[ECSC]]
- [[EEC]]
- common market
	- 'vehicle' for integration
	- spillover
- dynamics
	- [[CJEU]]
	- [[Dassonville Case]]
	- [[Cassis Case]]
	- [[Keck Case]]
	- [[Movement of X]]
## Forms of Economic Integration
>an area without internal frontiers in which the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital is ensured in accordance with the provisions of the Treaties.
- [[Free Trade Area]] - FTA
- [[Customs Union]]
- [[Internal Market]] or "common market" or "single market"
- part of [[TFEU]]
- [[Movement of X]]
- should **stabilize Europe**
	- military conflict close to impossible
## The Creation of the Internal Market: Positive and Negative Integration 
- positive integration -> encouraging integration with new laws
- negative integration -> removing laws which stand against integration
	- very powerful tool
### Harmonization
- Art 114 TFEU
	- [[EP]] may adopt measures of harmonization
	- prohibition tobacco advertisement
	- basis is not just economic, could be e.g. health as well
	- very broad definition
	- allows overvoting of member states -> majority vote
		- except for sensitive areas
	- exception 1
		- if member state cannot implement harmonization measure on legitimate grounds the Commission needs to be notified
	- exception 2
		- if new scientific evidence relating to protection of environment, etc is present the member state shall notify the Commission
	- if such a notification is made
		- Commission approve/reject claim -> no decision = approval
	- criticized for relying on experts/science 
## Fundamental Freedoms
### Common Structure
- against discrimination
	- direct discrimination -> active citizenship
	- indirect discrimination -> language skills, residence requirements
- also against non-discriminatory measures against cross-border activity
	- e.g. packaging requirements
- **justified** discriminatory measures and non-discriminatory
	- non-exhaustive list of grounds
	- justified by [[Test of Proportionality]]
- review of justifications by [[CJEU]]
	- can be more or less stringent
	- Test of Sustainability weighted less
	- Test of Consistency weighted more
		- a country must act consistently with it's exceptions
		- e.g. reducing gambling addiction
			- gambling as state monopoly
			- then huge advertisements for state gambling
				-> something doesn't add up
		- [[Stoss Case]]
- have direct effect on national law
	- EU law being higher ranked than national law
- State Liability -> individuals may claim damages from member states which violate fundamental freedom
- Horizontal Effects -> individual-to-individual cases have been influenced by EU Law

### Free Movement of Goods
#### Customs Duties
- what is a **Good**?
	- products which can be valued in money and which are capable, as such, of forming the subject of a commercial transaction
	- works of art, electricity, gas, waste
	- produced within EU or third country
- products in free circulation (after tariffs are paid with imports)
- [[Measures having an Equivalent Effect]]
#### Internal Taxation
- no difference in internal taxation based imported/domestic
	- e.g. products from Germany may not be taxed different than Austrian ones
- similar products must be taxed the same
	- two red wines 
	- wine and beer in broader similar relationship
- there may be discriminatory measures for other reasons tho
	- e.g. energy consumption may be taxed
	- may be indirectly discriminatory when legitimate ground
	- e.g. foreign red wine need more energy during production than Austrian red wines -> foreign red wine taxed higher
#### Quantitative Restrictions
- limiting the amount or volume of a product imported is prohibited
- [[Dassonville Case]]
- not just "trading rules" but also other measures by states
- very broad reading
- on legitimate grounds (e.g. protection of health) can be justified
	- shall not be arbitrary discrimination
- exhaustive list of justifications + proportionality analysis
- [[Cassis Case]]
- [[Keck Case]]
- Horizontal Effect
	- measures not just against member states, but private persons and companies
	- German TUEV affected
		- products which are certified pose a discriminatory threat against non-certified products
