## 📎 Executive Summary
The climate crisis is still ongoing and the emissions are still increasing despite all efforts. Should we want to reach the 1.5 C mark we need to act quickly and decisive like we haven't done since [[WW2]]. Pollution attribution and income levels are correlated.
## 👁️ Key Findings
- Almost vertical drop in emissions necessary
![[pathway_to_1_5_C_cumulative_emissions.png]]
- Canada, US, Australia, Russia have most pollution per capita
- China and India only a fraction of pollution per capita
- Highest Income accountable for highest pollution
- Next climate meeting ([[COP]]26) will be held in 2026, by then we will have "lost" the 1,5 C mark
- Lobbying from fossil fuel companies still super strong
