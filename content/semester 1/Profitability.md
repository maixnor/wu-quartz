# Profitability of Startups
- Profitability may be low or even negative
- Growth is more important than profits
- Liquidity still important
- dependent on external financing
	- should external financing stop, difficult situation
- sometimes negative profits extend beyond startup phase
	- look at [[Uber]] or food delivery services
		- still "growing"/trying to get more market share
	- or look at [[OpenAI]] - still not profitable
