> When is the investment fully paid back?

This is important because of financing activities. When getting a loan from a bank it is important to know how long the payment terms will be. It is easier to get a loan for 5 years than for 10.

Amortization = Assets Costs / (Profit + Depreciation)

[[Depreciation]] is added to the profit because the cash has never left the company. It is present in the [[financial reporting]] but the bank accounts stay untouched -> [[Financial Reporting#Exceptions to triangular relationships|see here]]

- basically, taking interest payments into account when calculating a loan
- a loan is never just the money you borrowed, but also interest payments on the remaining balance
- neutral amortization ... monthly loan repayments = interest costs
	- loan will never go away
- positive amortization ... monthly > interest
	- loan will decline, faster with every month since the interest decreases
- negative amortization ... monthly < interest
	- loan will only increase in size, as the interest keeps costing more than the monthly repayments provide
