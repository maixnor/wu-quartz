Important Stuff to know:
- [[Balance Sheet]]
- Bookkeeping -> [[Accounting]]
- [[Cost/Profit Statement]]
## Key Questions
- how to measure financial business performance?
- how to measure the value of a company?
- how to ensure liquidity/solvency?
- how to decide on investments?
## Example Taxi OPC
- Lena wants to become a entrepreneur
	- has no idea what to do
	- wants to work her own hours and earn as much money as possible
- Lena has some money (investments)
- Lena wants to provide value to customers
	- Lena finds out about the revenue of a taxi driver from a friend
	- After many conversations she can expect 3.000 monthly **revenue**
	- she can expect 500 monthly **ongoing expenditures**
	- **operating cash** flow is 2.500
- But what about the car?
	- 40.000 upfront is a great **capital expenditure** (**CAPEX**)
	- paid once ... then just used for several years
	- an **investment** into an asset
	- after 5 years the care will be worth 15.000 (willhaben)
	- in 5 years a comparable car will cost 45.000 (market trend)
	  -> + 5.000 [[inflation]] over 5 years
	- 40.000 - 15.000 + 5.000 = 30.000 **[[depreciation]]** over 5 years

**[[Depreciation]]** ... Loss of Value, Loss of Wealth due to time/usage
**[[Depreciation#Straight Line|straight line depreciation]]** ... each year the same amount of depreciation
## Cash Flow Statement
**net cash flow** after year 1: - 10.000 
**net cash flow** after year 2: 30.000 
year 3 & 4 are like year 2: 30.000 (60.000 combined)
year 5: **net cash flow**: 0

[[Free Cash Flow]]: 80.000 over 5 years
## Income Statement
also known as [[Profit and Loss Statement]]

Don't think about how much money left the bank account, but how many resources you have used. Spreading the cost of the taxi (25.000) on all 5 years instead of just the first year

**Expenditure** ... Paying for something (Paying for gas at gas station)
**Expense** ... Using up resources (Driving car)

**Depreciation** is an **Expense**.

Profit/Loss Statements produce values over a specific time range (Quarter, Year, Month)

**Cost of sales method**:
Profit is the monetary value of the goods **sold** minus the monetary value of the resources that have been consumed

**Cost of production method**:
Profit is the monetary value of the goods **produced** minus the monetary resources of the resources that have been consumed

Profit of each year: 
Revenue - ongoing Expenditures - Expenses (Depreciation) = 25.000 
## Balance Sheet
Which assets and debt do I have? How rich (wealth) am I?

**Assets** right, **Claims** left
Assets - Claims = 0

**Net Worth** ... Assets - Liabilities
### Assets
Assets are split into 
- Non-Current Assets (stays in the company for long duration)
- Current Assets (short-term assets)
### Claims
- Equity (net-worth in the beginning of the year)
- Profit
- Liabilities
## Financial Ratios
- [[Financial Ratios]]
## Corporate Finance
- turning an investment into a [[Cash Flow]] Stream
	- cash out flow -> the investment (buying a new machine)
	- cash in flow -> increased production/sales -> increased cash flow

> When a company has liabilities and equity it is impossible to tell which investment is funded by which.

All Claims are equal, whether equity or liabilities
### Decisions
- Financing Decisions -> Where is the money coming from?
- Investment Decisions -> What am I gonna use the money for?
	- shareholders need to be pleased
### Analysis of Stocks
- [[Market Analysis]]
- How is the whole industry developing?
- How will the specific company develop relative to the industry?
- Will the company have any interesting developments in the future?

## Value of a Company
The value of a company is rarely put together with simple step-by-step calculations. It is mostly a combination of many factors.  It is mostly about how much the company will yield to investors in the future, not necessarily about how much the company is "worth" right now
### Sheet Logic Value
Assets - Liabilities = Equity

this is incomplete to what the company will be worth and a buying decision should not be made just by the [[Balance Sheet]]
### Economic Value
The Value is determined by the future prospects of earnings or cash flow from this company

Factors are
- Management -> C-Level leaving/dying
- Research -> e.g. Pharma and Bio Tech huge impact
- [[Intangible Assets]] -> dependent on company
- [[Intellectual Property]] -> dependent on company
### Shares Value
- [[Market Capitalization]]
### Forecast Value
Investors only interested in future profits
Generating forecasts on how the company is going to perform

Attaching a monetary value to a [[Cash Flow]] Stream

Money of the future in comparison to today
### Discounting
- [[Discounting]]
### Amortization
- How long is the investment going to take to pay for itself?
- Either by cutting costs or increasing sales
### Putting it all together
- predict future [[Cash Flow]]s
- define [[Profitability]], what counts towards profit
- [[Discounting|discount]] them with current interest rates
- is expected to be close to the [[Market Capitalization]]
- there is no "correct" way of calculating the value
- other factors: 
	- [[Income Tax]]
	- information of investors, providers of debt or other stakeholders
	- measuring and managing the financial performance of the company
- everything is just approximation
	- "consulting the local glas sphere"
