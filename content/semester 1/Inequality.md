# Concepts
## Absolute vs Relative Poverty
- economic growth -> reduction in absolute poverty
	- [[covid]] reversed some of that
- below 2.1 USD per day deemed not sufficient for productive life
	- different measure is needed
- social exclusion -> relative poverty
	- poor people vs rich people
	- if there were no rich people there would be no poor people
	- high income -> high relative poverty rate
- Scissors of average income
	- top 1% rising
	- bottom 50% dropping
- what is interesting? 
	- Opportunity or Outcomes?
	- how to measure income?
	- how to measure inequality?

## Opportunity or Outcome?
- example running race
	- opportunity -> start
	- outcome -> leaderbord
- related
	- fixing one will fix the other
- measuring [[Income]]
	- sum (earnings of participants) + capital income + private transfers
	- = household market income
	- = household equivalised disposable income
		- different scalings with larger households
			- transport -> exponential
			- food -> linear
			- heating -> constant
	- + value of [[Public Services]] (education, public transport, etc)
	- = Household extended Income

## Based Justice(s)
- #wontfix fill from slides
### Needs Based Justice
### Performance Based Justice
### Market Based Justice
### Opportunity Based Justice
### Participatory Justice
### Environmental Justice

## Measure Inequality
- [[GINI Index]]
	- higher GINI Index -> higher inequality
- Upper Tail Inequailty -> 90:50 ratio, 99:90 ratio, 100:99 ratio
- Lower Tail Inequality -> 50:10 ratio
- Mean/Median ration -> Greater outliers on top/bottom of income distribution
## Why should I care?
- endogenous fiscal policy
	- #wontfix slides
- human capital accumulation theory
	- untapped potential 
	- e.g. education
		- poorer children leaving school earlier
- higher shares of rich
	- lower propensity to consume
		- more saving
		- less re-investment or spending
- negative link of inequality and growth
	- [[OECD]] study
		- [[Trends in Income Inequality - OECD]]
	- mostly due to human capital accumulation theory
- Book [[The Spirit Level]] by [[Richard Wilkinson]] and [[Kate Pickett]]
	- life expectancy
	- physical health
	- mental health
	- drug abuse
	- obesity
# Consequences
### Life Expectancy
- #wontfix get image from life expectancy/income diagram
	- higher development -> higher life expectancy
	- income is pointless -> money cannot be eaten
		- income can only pay for healthcare etc
- #wontfix get image of tube system with life expectancy
### Linked Social Aspects
- #wontfix get diagram of inequality vs health and social problems
	- correlation between inequality and social health
- other linked aspects
	- CO2 emissions
	- democracy
	- crime (and status anxiety)
	- education
	- health
# Causes
### Direct Access
- Lack of access to 
	- health care
	- good food
	- plenty exercise
	- education
### Status Anxiety
- not on top of the monkey rock
- low [[Social Status]]
- social hierarchy / ladder
- leading to stress, leading to poor health
### Others
- [[Stress]] in the womb
- parents socio-economic status
## Education
- parent's income significant in children's performance
- babies already affected by parents'income 
- IQ is related to income of parents
- just knowledge of social status degrades performance
- black/white students perform significantly different in "knowledge tests" but the same in "problem solving tests"
	- african-american students perform worse in "knowledge tests"
## Social Graduation
- due to [[Social Status]], not due to IQ or Ability
- #wontfix get more from slides (56)
- positive feedback look -> reinforcing effects
## Populist Voting
#wontfix get from slides
- [[Dani Rodrik]]
## Climate Change
- related to [[Climate Change]]
	- [[Emissions]]
	- [[Emissions#Emission Distribution]]
- [[Climate Change Policies by Social Status]]
	- [[Fossil Fuel Lobby]] challenging most anti-fossil-fuel concepts/legislations
## Education Gap
- demand for university students was hit
	- pay decreased
- #wontfix slides get image from skill percentile to tasks
- higher skill level -> more abstract, less routine and manual tasks
### Automation Impact
- Most middle-skilled jobs automated by computers
- high-skilled jobs still in high demand
- low-skilled jobs hard to automate -> not yet obsolete
- 47% of jobs will be destroyed in the next 20 years (USA)
