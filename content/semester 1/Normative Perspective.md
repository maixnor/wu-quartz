# Business Ethics
##  Ford Pinto Case
- VW Beetle became very popular
- Ford countered with a new car model "Pinto"
- extremely cost-efficient manufacturing
	- cheaper gas tank (just 1$ cheaper)
	- cheaper tank was unsafe
- car with cheaper tank exploded, killing a family
- decision between 
	- reconstruction of all cars -> expensive
	- compensating the families after accidents
- decision was to compensate families after fatal crashes
	- decision against human lives for extra profit
	- consumer rent (lives) vs producer rent (money)
- whistle blower leaked this decision making

- who is responsible for the damages?
	- the engineers who made the tank
	- the managers that did nothing
	- the CEO that made the decision

## VW emissions scandal
- cheating when measuring carbon emissions
- again... who is to blame?
	- the engineers that made the cheating machinism
	- the middle manager that pressurized the engineers
	- the managers that set unrealistic expectations
	- the CEOs that did not care enough

## Systems
- if there are incentives to cheat people will cheat
- behaving in a morally right way is **expensive**
- how can one enforce morally right behavior
	- innovation is a solution
	- creativity of founders are key
		- not just technical tradeoffs
		- also moral tradeoffs
- politicians, government and wealth are not going to solve the problems of the future
	- entrepreneurs will solve the problems with innovation
	- consuming socially responsibly
	- selecting a responsible employer
