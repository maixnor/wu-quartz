# Symmetry
a function $f$ is called 
- *symmetric about $a$* if for all $x$ it holds that
	- $f(a + x) = f(a -x)$
	- moving it about x- or y-axis still preserves *symmetry*, just $a$ has to adjust
- *even* if $f$ is symmetric about 0, i.e.
	- $f(x) = f(-x)$
	- moving it along the y-axis still holds the *even* property
	- examples: $x^2, x^4 + 6, x^{16} + x^8$
- *odd* if for all $x$ it holds that 
	- $f(-x) = -f(x)$
	- moving it along the y-axis destroys the *odd* propetry (adding a constant)
	- examples: $x^3, x^1, x^{17}$
	- if $0$ is in the domain, $f$ needs to include the point (0,0)
		- careful, this is not a general definition, $x^2$ still has (0,0), but is even

# Monotonicity 
*increasing* if $a < b \Rightarrow f(a) \leq f(b)$
*decreasing* if $a < b \Rightarrow f(a) \geq f(b)$

*strictly increasing* if $a < b \Rightarrow f(a) < f(b)$
*strictly decreasing* if $a < b \Rightarrow f(a) > f(b)$

Also applicable to intervals of functions. i.e. $x^2$ is *strictly increasing* on $[0, \infty]$

Any constant function, is *increasing* and *decreasing*, neither of which *strictly*.

A *local extremum* is a point where a function changes its *monotonicity*

Trigonometric functions are not monotone (they increase and decrease). They are periodical functions because they repeat their values within 2 bounds.

# Convexity & Concavity
*conVex* if opens upwards (smiley face)
*concAve* if opens downwards (frowny face)

when connecting 2 lines on a function the line is either always above (convex) or always below (concave) the function. This must hold through the entire domain (x-range). Functions (like sin, cos) are both convex and concave, but in different domains. Should there be an inflection point within the domain, neither convexity nor concavity can be attributed.

linear function are both convex and concave.

An *inflection point* is is a point where a graph changes *convexity*. 

there is also strictly convex and strictly concave functions.
