## Limited Liability
![[Limited Liability]]

### Creditor Self Help
how do creditors deal with [[Limited Liability#Shady Shareholder Tactics|Shareholder Tactics]]
- no limited liability
	- [[Collateral]] or personal guarantee of shareholders
 - [[Covenants]]
 - Accelerated Debt
	 - if there is a large change in e.g. [[leadership]] the entire liability is due

why is legal restriction still needed?
- some creditors lack the bargaining power or experience
	- employees (if salary is paid after value creation)
	- suppliers 
	- customers paying in advance
- involuntary creditors
	- companies that receive damages ([[Tort Law]])
- state (crediting tax and social security money)
	- often a major creditor in insolvencies

### Limits of Limited Liability
- [[veil piercing]]
- liability directly against creditors
	- e.g. continuing trade after [[Insolvency]]

## Legal Capital
- to found a company one needs the starting capital
- here: capital = equity
- [[Share#Share Premium]]
- legal capital stays fixed, part of equity
- criticism as meaningless 
	- too little or too high for some lines of business
	- entry barrier for limited liability
	- meaningless information on balance sheet
- also has upsides
	- proxy for reputability
	- higher initial investment, higher reputability
- in Austria legal capital is reduced for the first 10 years to 10k
	- questions of importance of 35k

## Raising Capital
- cash considerations
	- simple, cash is cash
- condiresations in kind
	- hard to pinpoint exact value
	- different valuation strategies
	- no cushion to creditors
	- no proxy for reputability
	- liability for difference in advertised and actual price
	- checked by independent court-appointed expert with AG
- balance between protecting creditors and flexibility
- hidden contribution in kind
	- buying a car directly with initial investment from founder instead of supplying his car directly
	- cash payment has to be invested again (twice)

## Maintenance of Capital
- only profits distributed to shareholders
- if assets - liabilities > reserves -> dividends possible
	- non-distributable reserves are mandated by law
- accounting rules made to protect creditors
	- e.g. value of fixed assets capped at buying price
	- understating the actual business value
- different account rules sets -> different outcomes
	- higher profits under [[International Financial Reporting Standards|IFRS]] than under Austrian rules
- liquidity is not part of balance sheet
	- even if there is a profit in the balance sheet the company may not be able to pay the [[Dividend|dividends]] since the profits are tied up in less liquid assets like real estate
- hidden or disguised distributions (illegal)
	- parent company pays lower than market value prices to subsidiaries
		- called transactions '[[At Arms Length]]'
		- e.g. the owners wife is employed despite not working i.e. providing value to the company
	- if reported the money needs to be payed back or compensated otherwise
	- most common with majority shareholders, again discriminating against minority shareholders

## Creditor Protection through Insolvency Law
![[Insolvency]]

### Liability Issues
- the directors are not liable for the failing company
	- except grossly negligent
	- if grossly negligent -> personally liable to creditors
- if not enough funds for [[Insolvency#Insolvency Proceedings]] owners is not permitted to open another company within 3 years
-  Shareholders are covered by [[Limited Liability]], but...
	- hidden distributions may surface -> repayment
	- fraudulent dividends have been payed
- Creditors that cease their collateral shortly before insolvency may have that revoked and the collateral added to the split

### Pressures
- directors experience pressures
- shareholders pressure to keep going
- law and social security pressure to file for insolvency
- difficult if director and shareholder are same person
	- common in small to medium companies
