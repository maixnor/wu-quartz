- Inequality is a problem
- Global Warming is a **global** problem now
- Job loss facing push-backs, even in well-educated jobs
- moving from complicated societies to complex societies

Andrew Sheng is trying to promote a future which is equal for everyone. Inequality is next to global warming a large portion of his arguments. He is of the opinion that we "are using 19th or 20th century glasses to look at 21st century problems". Apart from climate change the large challenge is the globalization of knowledge, especially in Asia.
