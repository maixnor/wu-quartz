#### Core arguments by Lawrence Summers
- cost of pollution = harm by death or injury
	- therefore lowest cost in low development countries
- costs rise disproportionately as pollution increases
	- from dirty (developed) to clean (less developed) countries reduces costs (a form of spreading the load of pollution)
- clean environment more important with higher income
	- costs fall if pollution is with lesser income countries

#### The conflict
It all seems so wrong, but how can you argue against it?

Assumptions of Lawrence
- the value life can be measured in life expectancy
	- the life of an american is worth more than of an african peasant

#### Poverty and Pollution
- The greatest cause of misery in the world is [[Poverty]]
	- Clean growth = slow growth 
	- leading to poverty that could have been mitigated
- More countries will choose more pollution for more growth
- There is a trade-off between Pollution and Growth
- "dirty" industries are chance to escape [[Poverty]]
- factors not included:
	- global vs local pollution
	- promote growth and clean development together
	- links between [[Trade Policy]] and environment
