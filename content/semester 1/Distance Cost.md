# General
- With increased technology the "size" of the world decreases
	- e.g. I can reach a server in China in 150ms
	- e.g. I can travel to Australia in 24h, on foot I can travel max 100km in 24h
- time-space compression
- faster turnover time
- capitalism causes the geographical expansion

## Factors
- physical travel time
	- e.g. suez/panama canal
- information travel time and cost
	- historically ... letter delivery time
	- now ... internet -> almost 0 cost/distance
