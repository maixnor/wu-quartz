## Charles Babbage (1791-1871)
- **Analytical Engine:** Babbage designed the Analytical Engine, a mechanical general-purpose computer, in the 1830s. Although never fully built during his lifetime, it laid the foundation for future computing machines.
- **Concept of a Stored Program:** Babbage's Analytical Engine incorporated the concept of a stored program, where instructions and data were stored in the machine's memory. This concept is fundamental to modern computers and is a key aspect of data processing.
- **Precursor to Binary System:** Babbage's work contributed to the development of the binary system in computing, which is the basis for modern digital computers. His design involved the use of punched cards to input data and programs into the Analytical Engine.
