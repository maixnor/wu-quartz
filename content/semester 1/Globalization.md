# Production Possibility Frontier
- [[Production Possibility Frontier]]
## Principle of [[Comparative Advantage]]
- Mark can produce a lot of Meat 
- Pete can produce a lot of Potatoes

Mark has an [[Absolute Advantage]] on Meat, Pete on Potatoes.

Mark should produce only Meat and Pete should only produce Potatoes. 
Then they can trade the excess. 

There is a natural incentive for both Mark and Pete. They can, while splitting production and specializing, achieve previously unattainable amounts.

What if Mark is better at everything, has an [[Absolute Advantage]] on both Meat and Potatoes. btw, Production Frontiers can be nested within each other.

As long as you are *relatively better* (not absolutely better), you should specialize and engage in trade.

Countries that trade more are more likely to have a greater increase in GDP per capita. Form just this chart we cannot extrapolate the causality relationship; which cause causes which effect.

- exporting country: domestic consumer worse off
- trade may produce winners and losers, even if the global economy benefits
- benefits of trade
	- increased variety of goods
	- lower unit costs -> [[economy of scale]]
	- increased [[competition]]
