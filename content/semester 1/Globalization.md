Why trade?
- production possibility frontier
- principle of [[comparative advantage]]
- winners and losers of trade

- trade, globalization and economic development
- trade, globalization and inequality
- trade, globalization and the environment

2 different products (ice crean & shoes, potatoes & meat)

The curve signals the maximum amount of goods you can produce with the amount of resources (labour, capital, land, knowledge). The resources stay constant. Decision on how much of which I want to produce.

A great visualization of scarcity. 

A point:
 - on the curve: efficent
 - inside the curve: not efficent
 - outside the curve: unattainable

Shape of the curve:
how much do I have to sacrifice in my current product, so that I can produce 1 more unit of the other product
- straight
	- sacrifice stays constant (1:1)
- convex (outward)
	- products profit from being produced together
- concave (inward)
	- products do not profit from being produced together

# Principle of Comparative Advantage
=======
## Principle of [[Comparative Advantage]]
>>>>>>> a450d2a (stuff)
- Mark can produce a lot of Meat 
- Pete can produce a lot of Potatoes
#todo get image from slides

Mark has an [[Absolute Advantage]] on Meat, Pete on Potatoes.

Mark should produce only Meat and Pete should only produce Potatoes. 
Then they can trade the excess.

There is a natural incentive for both Mark and Pete. They can, while splitting production and specializing, achieve previously unattainable amounts.

What if Mark is better at everything, has an [[Absolute Advantage]] on both Meat and Potatoes. btw, Production Frontiers can be nested within each other.

#todo get the numbers from slide about gardener/farmer

As long as you are *relatively better* (not absolutely better), you should specialize and engage in trade.

Countries that trade more are more likely to have a greater increase in GDP per capita. Form just this chart we cannot exterpolate the causality relationsship; which cause causes which effect.

## Winners and Losers of Trade
- importing country: domestic consumer better off
- exporting country: domestic consumer worse off
- trade may produce winners and losers, even if the global economy benefits
- benefits of trade
	- increased variety of goods
	- lower unit costs -> economy of scale
	- increased competition
	- enhanced flow of ideas
<<<<<<< HEAD
- trade may increase within-country inequality while generating economic growth
