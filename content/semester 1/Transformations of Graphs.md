# Basic laws
- $f(x) + c$ ... move along by $c$ units along y axis
- $f(x + c)$ ... move along by $c$ units along x axis (inversed)
- $c*f(x)$ ... stretch ($c>1$) (or compress $1 > c > 0$) vertically or flip it along x-axis ($c < 0$)
	- this can also shift along y-axis 
	- $f(x) = sin(x) + 3)$ has its center value at 2 ($2 < f(x) < 4$)
	- $g(x) = 2 * f(x)$ has its center value at 6 ($4 < f(x) < 8$)
- $f(c*x)$ ... compress ($c > 1$) (or stretch $1 > c > 0$) vertically or flip it along y-axis ($c < 0$)
