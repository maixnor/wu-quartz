## A Tiny Introduction to Economics
Macroeconomics ... using statistics to understand reality
Microeconomics ... looking at specific groups and their decisions
### Definition
>The study of how society makes choices in managing its scarce resources and the consequences of this decision-making

Issues like
- scarcity and choice
- trade-offs and [[Opportunity Cost]]
- marginal thinking ([[Marginal Changes]])
- incentives and reaction to them

Scope:
- which policy measures reduce unemployment?
- how should central banks conduct monetary policy?
- how can we avoid that firms pollute the environment?
- why do people become criminals?

### Examples

#### The impact of legalized abortion on crime.

Theory: With legalized abortion the crime rate decreases because the people that are not born, would later in life become a criminal with a higher chance. 

Great example because:
- a lot of variability for 50 different states
- a lot of data on other aspects of this problem 

#### Oil and the duration of dictatorships

Theory: Dictators with a lot of natural resources should have longer duration in their dictatorships, since they have more resources to burn through to keep the people happy.

#### Up or Down? Toilet Seat Etiquette

a mathematical system about if it is worth it to always put down the toilet seat after peeing.

#### On the efficiency of ACDC

- Bon Scott had a nice voice which was the signature part of the band
- Bon Scott died of alcohol
- They found Brian Johnson, a very similar voice
- huge controversy about who was the better vocalist

They did:
- played an [[Ultimatum Game]] experiment
- game was played in 2 rooms separately
	- one room played music from Bon Scott
	- one room played music from Brian Johnson
- Scoring: Which got more total income (accepted offers) 
- Brian Johnson Music won

## Scarcity and Choice
- economic activity: interaction between households and frims
- households cannot meet all wants and needs
- scarcity: society has limited resources, cannot meet all needs of all people
- how to best allocate resources for best meeting of needs/wants

## Trade-Offs
- trading off benefits/costs of options
- at societal level are different trade-offs

## Marginal Thinking
Revenue $R(x)$ and Costs $C(x)$

let profit be a function:
$\pi (x) = R(x) - C(x)$

then we can maximize the function (derivative = 0)
$\frac{d\pi (x)}{dx} = \frac{dR (x)}{dx} - \frac{dC (x)}{dx} = 0$

This model requires *rationality* of all participants.

Marginal Quantities: When changing the inputs a little, how does the output change.

Finding a way that the marginal revenue matches their marginal costs. Then their profit is maximized.

## Abstraction and Mathematics
Economics often use abstract models, often in mathematical form.

Advantages:
- transparent language for results and benchmarks
- allowing a (hopefully) straightforward way to confront the theoretical results with empirical evidence through predictions 

Role Model of Physics:
- when throwing a fall off a building, what is the speed after 3 seconds?
	- Physics has no problem with using wrong model
	- the problem with this model is air friction
	- It doesn't matter in our model, because it is negligible
- Economics wants to do it like that
	- a lot of abstractsion
	- a lot of assumptions, to keep complexity down
	- question: did I abstract and assume the correct things?
		- air friction negligible when dropping a ball 3 meters, but not when calculating for max speed of a falling ball

Problem of social sciences:
- Impossible (or at least very hard) to conduct [[experiment]]

The Toolbox of an economics:
- empiricism
- rationalism
- deduction
- induction
## Popper Logic
- [[Popper Logic]]
## Cause and Effect
Pattern Matching is used to derive insights from data.

Then we search for causality and implications of this patterns 
Correlation != Causality

## Positive vs Normative Analysis
- Why is unemployment higher for teenagers than older workers?
- What should the government do to improve the well-being of teenagers?

Positive Statement ... Can be falsified ... scientific statements
Normative Statement ... includes opinions ... cannot be tested

Positive and Normative statements tend to get mixed up.
## Critical Thinking
6 rules of evidental reasoning (Lett, 1990)
- Falsifiability
- Logic
- Comprehensive
- Honesty
- Replicability
- Sufficiency

## Occam's Razor
When there are 2 hypotheses that explain the situation equally well, then choose the simpler one.

## Logical Fallacies
- Ad hominem
	- oh no, that guy is a nazi, therefore the statement must be wrong
- Argument from authority
- Appeal to ignorance
- Post hoc, ergo propter hoc
	- just because one thing happened after another doesnt mean, that they cause each other
