- Cross-Border Deforestation Index

- Satellite Images for forest cover
	- difference trees from bushes and barren land
- measure Forest Cover from both countries close to border
	- issue: External Validity -> [[Reliability and Validity#Internal vs External Validity]]
	- across the border the regional difference in [[GDP]] per capita might not be as different as the rest of the country
	- borders are likely to run along a natural change in geography (e.g. mountain ranges)
	- land is not perfectly comparable on both sides of the border
	- solution: colonial borders -> straight lines
	- another issue: most areas with colonial borders forests are not a big thing
	- solution: another project mapping areas of homogeneous response units:
		- same slope, terrain, resources across borders
	- after combining response units with deforestation data we have enough data points for a good [[experiment]]
		- Brazil vs Bolivia is good example
		- China: depending on which border the difference is great
		- Dominican Republic: Wild Fires during Slave Revolts decimated forest cover 
- outcome:
	- forest cover decreases until approximately Brazil's current [[GDP per capita]] and increases from then onward
