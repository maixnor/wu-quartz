## Overview
| Buyers / Sellers | One                | Few                 | Many      |
| ---------------- | ------------------ | ------------------- | --------- |
| One              | Bilateral monopoly | Limited Monopoly    | Monopoly  |
| Few              | Limited Monopsony  | Bilateral oligopoly | Oligopoly |
| Many             | Monopsony          | Oligopsony          | Polypoly  |
## Competition vs Monopoly
- competition => [[Monopoly]]
- many sellers buyers => one seller, many buyers
- homogeneous good => single product
- free entry for competitors => limited entry ([[Market Entry Barriers]])
- price is given => price is set by company (high market power)
- p = MC, p = AC => profit is maximized by output of $q$ where MR=MC
## Market Power
- if players in an [[Oligopoly]] are talking to one another they can form an almost monopoly where they can plan their joint supply
	- results in market power similar if not equal to monopoly
- market power ... ability to influence the market
	- in perfect competition the price is given -> 0 market power
## Math and Stuff
### Marginal Revenue Function (Linear)
- demand/price: $P(Q) = a - bQ$
- Revenue: $R(Q) = P(Q) * Q = (a - bQ) * Q = aQ - bQ^2$
- $MR(Q) = a - 2bQ$
	- same curve, but with twice the slope
### Increasing Production
- increasing production will increase the revenue
- but the price needs to be adjusted -> demand stays equal
- $MR < p$ ... Marginal Revenue always optimal, production below optimum
### Price Setting
- in a monopoly there is 1:1 mapping between price and demand
	- we can choose the price and find out about the demand then
- very easy to calculate the revenue
- optimal production rate when factoring in costs
	- Marginal Costs = Marginal Revenue is best production cost
	- $MC = MR$
	- from that we get the optimal quantity to produce
	- from what we can get the price with the demand function
### Amoroso-Robinson Formula
$$MR = p + p\frac{1}{\epsilon _d}$$
- $\epsilon_{d}$ ... elasticty -> [[Micro Formula Sheet]]
- in perfect competition: $\epsilon _d = -\infty \implies MR = p$
	- constant marginal revenue: horizontal curves
	- small price increase -> complete loss of demand
- market power: $-1 > \epsilon _d > -\infty \implies MR < p$
	- negatively sloped market demand & marginal revenue curves
- inelastic demand $-1 < \epsilon _d < -\infty \implies MR < 0$
	- negative marginal revenue -> choose an output level which is in elastic demand
### Optimal Prices
$$p = mMC$$
- $m$ ... Markup
### Lerner Index
$$\frac{p - MC}{p} = -\frac{1}{\epsilon _d}$$
- Lerner index ... left side
- $0 < L < 1$
- the higher the Lerner index, the less competition 
- the higher the markup, the less competition

| Industry  | Lerner Index | Markup Factor |
| --------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| ---       |              |               |
| Food      | 0.26         | 1.35          |
| Tobacco   | 0.76         | 4.17          |
| Textiles  | 0.21         | 1.27          |
| Apparel   | 024          | 1.32          |
| Paper     | 0.58         | 2.38          |
| Chemicals | 0.67         | 3.03          |
| Petroleum | 0.59         | 2.44          |
### Measuring Monopoly Power
- Lerner Index 1 -> complete Monopoly
- Lerner Index 0 -> perfect competition
- everything in between is some gradual change between extremes
### Monopoly and Demand
- more elastic demand -> lower markup 
- less elastic demand -> higher markup
### HHI Index
- [[HHI Herfindahl Hirschmann Index]]
### Social Cost
- consumer surplus ... difference between willingness to pay and actual price
- producer surplus ... profit + fixed costs
- monopoly produces less units at higher price
	- [[Rent Seeking]] or Corruption to keep monopoly
![[FM_social_cost_monopoly.png]]
## Natural Monopoly
- similar to [[Economy of Scale]]
- when a single company can produce all the supply cheaper than if the load was split among multiple companies
- very high fixed costs, low variable costs
- subadditive cost function ... $f(x,y) < f(x) + f(y)$
	- [[Baumol]]
- examples: 
	- Railroads
	- Roads
	- Telecommunications
	- Electricity
### Regulating the Price
- setting ceiling to the competitive level -> not good
	- at this level the company would not work
- setting ceiling such that the company has no profit -> perfect
	- company is willing to produce, but has little to no profit
	- best for maximized consumer surplus
	- infeasible due to lobbying and political ambitions
### Different Production Costs
- marginal costs should be equal in all sites $MC_1 = MC_2$
- first-order condition still holds:
	- $MC = MR$
- only partial redistribution of production, not complete redistribution
## Monopsony
- exact opposite of monopoly
- all market power with demand side
- e.g. military, labor market (in certain industry)
	- military is just 1 per country, but with many defense contractors
	- labor market can force low wages with lower amount of people
- instead of profit there is net value
	- Marginal Value = Marginal Expenditure
- monopsonist buyer wants to maximize net value
- sources of power
	- inelastic market supply
	- small number of buyers (or just 1)
	- little competition between buyers
- Monopoly: Marginal Expenditure = Actual Expenditure = Supply = Value
- Monopsony: Supply = Average Expenditure = Price
	- basically suppliers are forced to produce below market value

## Monopoly vs Monopoly
- monopoly
	- MR = MC
	- $q_m < q_c$
	- $p_m > p_c$
- monopsony
	- ME = MV
	- $q_m < q_c$
	- $p_m < p_c$
