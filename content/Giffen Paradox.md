# Giffen Paradox
- after [[Robert Giffen]]
- a good affected by this phenomenon is called a **Giffen Good**
- a good becomes cheaper -> increased demand
- relative income increases therefore
- increased relative income -> negative effect in demand
- negative effect in demand > increased demand due to cheaper prices
- one example: rice in Asia
	- as people get relatively richer, they consume less rice
