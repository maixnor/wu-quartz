### Shady Shareholder Tactics
- ex ante
	- overstate the corporate assets when getting a loan
		- protection through [[Accounting#Financial Statement]] 
		- [[Accounting#Accounting Rules]] and especially [[International Financial Reporting Standards|IFRS]]
		- independent auditors -> [[Auditing]]
		- professional creditors want forward-looking information (e.g. a [[Business Plan]]), not information on past ventures (Accounting Statements of last year)
		- [[Relationship Banking]] -> more professional creditors
		- [[Supplier Credit]] or a public [[Bond]] -> less professional creditors
- ex post 
	- [[siphoning-off of assets]]
		- e.g. paying above market value to parent company
	- shift in business strategy -> more risk
	- take on additional debt
