## Austrian Constitutional Law
- [ ] The ECHR is an international treaty which is why it is ranked as an ordinary federal law in Austria.
	-> constitutional law, not ordinary law
- [!] Austrian constitutional law is spread among various legal documents.
- [ ] The nine Land constitutions are the legal acts of the highest rank in the hierarchy of norms.
	-> nothing stands above federal constitution
- [!] The so-called hierarchy of norms is a theoretical concept to structure a legal system.

## Basic Principles of the Austrian Federal Constitution
- [ ] The legal position of the Federal President is part of the democratic principle.
	-> repulic principle, not part of democratic principle
- [!] Legal certainty and foreseeability of the legal order are essential parts of the principle of the rule of law.
- [ ] The Federal President’s term of office is ten years, with re-election not being possible.
	-> 6 years, re-eleciton is possible once

## Austrian Constitutional Law (Second Set)
- [ ] If ordinary constitutional law conflicts with rulings of the Austrian Constitutional Court, it is considered to be so-called unconstitutional constitutional law.
	-> rulings are not laws
- [ ] According to the principle of the separation of powers, a member of the Austrian government cannot simultaneously be a member of the Austrian Parliament.
	-> exception, member of government cannot be a judge
- [!] The legislative power is exercised by the Parliament. Members of Parliament are directly elected by Austrian citizens.
- [!] The executive power of the Federation is exercised by federal authorities and by Land authorities.

## EU Law Statements
- [ ] Directives are binding legal acts and directly applicable in all Member States.
	-> Regulations: directly applicable, no need to be transposed/implemented
	-> Directives: not directly applicable, need to be transposed into national law first
- [!] EU secondary law consists of legal acts based upon primary law.
- [ ] The [[preliminary reference procedure]] has enabled the CJEU to ensure a uniform interpretation and application of EU law in all Member States.
- [!] EU law constitutes supranational law, characterized by its direct effect and supremacy.
	-> no member state can decide whether the laws are to be applied

## EU Institutions
- [ ] The European Commission defines the general political directions of the EU.
	-> European Council instead of Commission
- [ ] The European Council consists of a representative of each Member State at ministerial level and proposes legislation to the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers.
	-> not the European Council, for normal Council in Austria it is true
	-> European Council composed of Head of States of member states
	-> proposing legislation is with the European Commission, not with European Council
- [!] The Court of Justice of the European Union is competent to review the legality of the acts of the EU’s institutions.
- [!] The Members of the European Parliament are directly elected by the Union’s citizens.

## Fundamental Freedoms
- [!] Packaging requirements for products, for instance, are also caught by the fundamental freedoms when their utilisation is impeded or rendered unattractive.
- [!] In order to invoke the fundamental freedoms, there needs to be a cross-border economic activity.
- [ ] Nationality requirements for professional players in sports are an example of indirect discrimination.
	-> direct discrimination, nationality requirements are always direct discrimination
- [ ] Directly discriminatory measures are also called de facto or disguised discriminatory measures.
	-> not disguised

## Free Movement of Goods
- [ ] the CJEU's jurispreduence following Keck had represented a distinctly liberalist approach.
	-> not following Keck, but Dassonville

- [!] In the Keck-Case, the CJEU held that national provisions restricting or prohibiting certain selling arrangements may – under certain conditions – be lawful under the provisions on the free movement of goods.
- [!] The CJEU’s approach in the Dassonville-Case allowed private businesses – in conjunction with direct effect and the supremacy of EU law – to challenge ever more frequently even non-discriminatory state regulations.
- [!] One aspect of the free movement of goods is the prohibition on market access.
	-> free movement of goods excludes prohibition on market access
	-> deemed true but with the concrete wording here it should be false

## Fundamental Rights
- [ ] Fundamental rights may be enforced before the Supreme Court of Austria.
	-> constitutional court
- [ ] The principles included in the [[CFR]] are self-standing rights which may be invoked by EU citizens in proceedings before the CJEU.
	-> CFR belongs to EU, but EU Citizens do not have the power to invoke proceedings
	-> Luxemburg Case
- [ ] As the objective of fundamental rights is to protect the individual against arbitrary action by public authorities, those rights cannot impose positive obligations on states.
	-> can impose positive obligations on states, e.g. rerouting traffic with demonstrations
- [!] Fundamental rights can be divided into different groups, such as civil liberties, rights of equality, and procedural guarantees.
