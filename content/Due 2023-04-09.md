Please post your questions/critical remarks relating to:
Crouch 2004, 243-245 (how did the relationship of states and markets evolve?)

Weiss 2010, 186-195 (what is the role of the state in neoliberalism?)
# Crouch
- nice part about the inception of lobbying
- bankruptcy as a mean for the protect the market itself is a very interesting thought I never had before
- communism just being a giant labor union? really? I think there is so much more to what it is, it's core values and it does to societies
# Weiss
- the possibility for corruption is the ability to withhold information, with always public information about government spending that would most likely lead to better usage of funds due to public pressure
- just privatizing everything cannot be the solution in a world where cars have taken over the planet (luckily not anymore so much in Europe) and climate change/protection not posing an economic incentive at all
- what is the [[LME Model]]?
- [[Dani Rodrik]] mentioned that there is no "discipline" in international markets
