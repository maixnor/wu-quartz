- clicker questions are not be recorded, they will be reused

- Annual Financial Statements are not publicly available in China
- Assets > Short-term Investments -> bonds, shares
- Liabilities > Provisions -> rather sure that you will pay something in the future (court case)

### Notes from Clicker Questions
- constraint in financial accounting under [[IFRS]]
	- cost-benefit: #todo what is this?
- impairment vs write-off
	- book value of an asset is decreased through depreciation
	- a sudden and unexpected event happens -> impairment
		- impairment would be checked at end of year
	- the act of adjusting the books -> write-off
- depreciation only on non-current assets, current assets might experience impairment tho
- operating result: EBIT, not EBITDA
	- definitely not the operating cash flow
- profit in books does not mean positive cash flow -> they can all receivables

# TikTok
- Sales in just US is 16 Billion USD
- ByteDance: owning company of TikTok
- ByteDance made 120 Billion in global revenue (+40% from previous year)
	- impressive increase, especially at this scale
- Meta made 135 Billion USD (only +16% from previous year)
- ByteDance declined to comment on financial data -> private company
	- publicly held = listed on stock exchange
- TikTok remains unprofitable -> huge sales, yet no profit
	- strong focus on growth -> investments lower profit
	- similar to if not purely R&D costs
- China "firmly opposes" any forced sale of TikTok
