- clicker questions are not be recorded, they will be reused

- Annual Financial Statements are not publicly available in China
- Assets > Short-term Investments -> bonds, shares
- Liabilities > Provisions -> rather sure that you will pay something in the future (court case)

### Notes from Clicker Questions
- constraint in financial accounting under [[IFRS]]
	- cost-benefit: #todo what is this?
- impairment vs write-off
	- book value of an asset is decreased through depreciation
	- a sudden and unexpected event happens -> impairment
		- impairment would be checked at end of year
	- the act of adjusting the books -> write-off
- depreciation only on non-current assets, current assets might experience impairment tho
- operating result: EBIT, not EBITDA
	- definitely not the operating cash flow
- profit in books does not mean positive cash flow -> they can all receivables

# TikTok
- Sales in just US is 16 Billion USD
- ByteDance: owning company of TikTok
- ByteDance made 120 Billion in global revenue (+40% from previous year)
	- impressive increase, especially at this scale
- Meta made 135 Billion USD (only +16% from previous year)
- ByteDance declined to comment on financial data -> private company
	- publicly held = listed on stock exchange
- TikTok remains unprofitable -> huge sales, yet no profit
	- strong focus on growth -> investments lower profit
	- similar to if not purely R&D costs
	- any profit distribution does not effect profit itself
- China "firmly opposes" any forced sale of TikTok

# Some more Henkel
- CEO says company is on a good path -> obviously
- Ebit Marge between 12% and 13.5%
- Competitor Beiersdorf did better than Henkel last year

### Earnings Call
- conference call of CEO + CFO with investors and analysts
- explaining what happened last year and what is planned for this year
	- 4.2% organic sales growth
	- battery production
	- plans to divest underperforming 350 Million EUR until end of 2024
		- underperforming ... not meeting profit margin of 12%
- free cash flow ... cash which can be used for anything -> [[Hierarchy of Financing]]
	- financing which is not bound to any agreement
	- e.g. when taking out a loan the bank wants to know what this money will be used for, your money you can used for ANYTHING

# Income Statement & Balance Sheet
- [[Profit and Loss Statement]] = [[Income Statement]], they are the same
- EBIT: operating result
- PBT: profit before tax
- (N)PAT: profit after tax
- 3 main types of costs -> cost of sales
	- materials
	- salaries
	- depreciation
- expenses by nature -> materials, salaries, depreciation
- expenses by function -> cost of sales, marketing, R&D, etc
