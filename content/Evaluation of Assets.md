# Historical Value
- purchase price
- does not change, ever
- in the books: actual $\leq$ historical, never higher than historical value
	- principle of [[Prudence]]

### Exception under IFRS
- IAS 40, [[IFRS]]
- if real estate is held for investment purposes you can choose fair value

# Fair Value
- current market value when selling to neutral buyer
- may fluctuate according to market value
- how to find the market value?
	- active market -> stock price, copper price
	- compare to market -> my glass sphere tells me price X if I would sell now
	- formulas -> [[Discounting#discounted]] Cash Flow of the next years (e.g. with buildings it would be rent) 


# Signa Overvalue Case
- Donald Trump did not do the same, he probably just made up numbers for the banks
- real estate firm going bankrupt
- overvaluing occured because of 
	- [[Discounting]] with discounting rate of almost 0
	- it is allowed to value the asset at the expected value after an e.g. sanitation project
	- very optimistic planning of projects

# Example - 1st Discrict
- bought a house in 1st District for 50.000 -> historical 
- current fair value would be 50.000.000
- historical value caps value at 50.000 -> [[Evaluation of Assets#Exception under IFRS|except if under IAS 40]] 
- fair value would be relevant to investors anyway
