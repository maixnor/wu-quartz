### Ontology
- the study of "what is"
	- wether some fundamental stuff exists
		- "Is there a god?"
	- defined before empirical research
	- a set of beliefs and assumptions
- Which problem is central to the economy?
	- scarcity
	- change
	- dominance
	- uncertainty
- From which “thing” should inquiry start if we want to acquire knowledge about the economy?
	- micro: individuals and their motivations, relations and actions
	- meso: groups and organisations
	- macro: systems and structures (capitalism)
- Do actors (people, firms, etc) exist independent of their context
	- context ... the world around them including all incentives
	- Atomist: the actors exist independently
	- Middle: they exist independently, but are influenced by their context
	- Contextual: They cannot exist without their context. That would be fundamentally different
- Time?
	- Static: Time is a succession of states, which can be identified.
	- Middle: Both static and procedural elements are present in time.
	- Dynamic: It is of primary importance to think in a procedural way, things are constantly changing and evolving in time.

### Epistemology
- study of knowledge
- What can we know and how can we arrive at knowledge?
	- What are the necessary and sufficient conditions of knowledge?
	- What are its sources?
	- What is its structure, and what are its limits?
- Is there a "real world" or just our interpretations of it?
	- Realism: independent world of human conceptions we can observe
	- Middle: real world but also discursive world (scientific access)
	- Constructivist: our interpretations give the world meaning
- Is the perspective with its mode of though focused on one object or applies in general terms?
	- Perspective Driven: consistent thoughts throughout all objects
		- capable of yielding valuable insights in all kinds of economic and social phenomena
	- Object Driven: a specific problem is analysed with different ways of thinking
	- Contested: both tendencies are present, conflict when trying to move to just one perspective while others don't
### Methodology
- What counts as justified knowledge?
	- set of rules or conditions for something to be scientific
- Methods of research: ![[methods_of_research.png]]
- How does a perspective predominantly formulate its hypothesis?
	- hypotheses ... theory for explaining a phenomenon
	- deductive: logically derived from another hypothesis
	- inductive: empirical observations lead to new hypotheses
	- middle: inductive and deductive mixed with axioms (following)
- How can we generate and evaluate a theory or a hypothesis at the abstract level?
	- formalistic: logical derivations from axioms, no logical mistakes
	- broad reasoning: any other non-formalistic reasoning, less exact
		- counterfactuals, thought experiments, deconstruction, changing conceptualizations and fuzzy sets, heuristics, storytelling
	- Middle: both formalistic and broad reasoning
- How can we relate a theory or a hypothesis to reality?
	- Standardised and prescriptive methodology: _the_ scientific method
	- Idiosyncratic: non-standard practices, depending on researcher and phenomenon studied
		- semi-structured interviews, genealogy, counterfactuals and discourse analysis
	- Middle: both standardised and non-standard methods are used
### Axiology
- Axioms
	- not like hypotheses or theories -> tested against empirical data
	- more like heuristics -> ideas/frameworks how to form hypotheses
- derived from work of [[Imre Lakatos]] 
	- heuristics are preanalytic 'hard core' of a paradigm
	- terminological expressions
		- not self-evident statements
		- codes and concepts employed within a perspective
### Values
- Ideals: normative convictions describing 'good' things in economics 
- Policies: concrete measures that should bring the economy into a normatively better state

Statements and Opinions often include both ideals and policy suggenstions.
