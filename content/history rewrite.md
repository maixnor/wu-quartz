In the exploration of game theory, particularly through the contributions of John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern, we identify a transformative moment in economic thought. Their seminal work, The Theory of Games and Economic Behavior, published in 1944, established a rigorous framework for analyzing strategic interactions among rational economic agents. This work was initially inspired by von Neumann's fascination with the mathematical foundations of economics and expanded during discussions with Morgenstern, transitioning from a simple article to a comprehensive book of significant depth (Chapter 17).

At the core of their analysis lies the concept of zero-sum games, where any gain by one player corresponds to a loss for another. This foundational idea introduced the notion of equilibrium in competitive environments—an innovation that parallels the strategic decision-making highlighted in Cournot's duopoly theory discussed in earlier chapters (Chapter 4). While Cournot approached this complexity by assuming that competitors react to each other's choices, von Neumann and Morgenstern offered a broader perspective, analyzing not just competitive but also cooperative scenarios.

Moreover, the evolution of game theory marked a shift toward employing advanced mathematical techniques, such as set theory, contrasting with the differential calculus predominantly used in earlier economic literature. This development reflects a parallel with Hicks and Samuelson’s contributions, as both emphasized the importance of rigorous mathematical modeling in economics (Chapters 16 and 17). While Hicks and Samuelson advanced welfare economics and optimization principles, von Neumann and Morgenstern’s work provided a new lens through which to view competition and cooperation.

Ultimately, the engagement with game theory in this context reveals the intricate connections and continuities within economic thought. The concepts established by von Neumann and Morgenstern highlight that economics involves not merely isolated decisions but the interplay of strategies and actions among various agents, thus enriching the understanding of complex contemporary economic phenomena (Chapter 18).

Through game theory we can clearly see a transformative movement in the way we think about economics. Through the contributions of John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern alike a previously unprecedented framework was created to analyze strategies between rational agents in economic contexts. As laid out in chapter 17 Neumann was fascinated with the numerical aspects of economics and the idea further developed during discussions with Morgenstern; from a simple article to an in-depth book.

The ideas brought forth are not new. Already Cournot's duopoly theory from chapter 4 discusses similar characteristics like the zero-sum game developed by Neumann and Morgenstern. Here any gain of one agent is necessarily the loss of the other agent and therefore one can derive a clear equilibrium where both players based on either tradeoffs (game theory) or production functions (Cournot) create a point where both players play optimally and any deviation would result in a worse situation for both players. Only game theory has expanded here to include cooperations as well as competitive environments.

Neumann and Morgenstern needed to apply more advanced mathematical concepts than the differential calculus predominantly used in the past. Set theory is a driving factor in game theory and allows for a simple analysis of games. Here we can again see a parallel to chapter 16 and 17 in which Hicks and Samuelson emphasize again the importance of mathematical modelling for economic literature. Although both teams advocate for mathematics Hicks and Samuelson were pioneers in welfare economics while Neu mann and Morgenstern provided a new vision on competition and cooperation. 

We can clearly see the importance of models in economics - regardless of field of study. Furthermore the importance of interaction of economic agents over individual decisions and strategies are vital to understanding contemporary economics as presented in chapter 18.
