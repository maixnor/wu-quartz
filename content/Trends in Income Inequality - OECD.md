# Trends in Income Inequality and its Impact on Economic Growth
by [[Federico Cingano]]
## üëÅÔ∏è Key Findings
- [[inequality]] and [[growth]] are negatively correlated
	- visible especially with longer/[[higher education]] enrollment
	- i.e. [[income inequality]] and [[GPD growth]]
- best tackled by [[tax the rich]]
- just growth alone may not trickle down to the ones who need it the most, limiting actual societal growth -> dive into [[Socioeconomics]]
- not just poverty (bottom 10%) but much greater (bottom 40%)
	- especially lower middle class falling behind
