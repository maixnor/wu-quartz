# General
- black death killed 30-40% of European population
- wealth per capita was about the same all before 1800
	- many cavemen had better lives than 1800s workers
	- e.g. diet, work hours
- Austria and Portugal have highest Celibacy Rates
- agricultural innovations before 1800
	- horseshoe and better harnesses
	- better ploughs & crop rotations
	- fertilizers (animal based)
	- keeping animals in barns
	- production of milk/leather/wool closer to cities

## Slow Growth Before 1800
- **serfdom**
	- no labor or land markets
	- no competition between land lords
	- no specialization or urbanization
- other market-unfriendly institutions
	- open fields
	- no interest allowed
	- monopolies, corruption, subsidies
	- guilds (i.e. local cartels)
- local -> little trade
- inefficient and poor -> unproductive agriculture
- badly organized -> no knowledge accumulation/innovation
- zero-sum mentality -> merchants unpopular, no saving/investing

## Great Divergence
- about 1800 with the industrial revolution
- income divergence

# Malthusian Theory or Trap
- any technological advance was lost due to population increase
	- linear food production function
	- exponential food consumption function
- life expectancy: 30-45 years
- birth/death rates (BR/DR) are dependent of living standards (LS)
	- better LS -> higher BR -> higher pop -> lower LS -> higher DR -> lower pop -> $\infty$
	- equilibrium reached around same LS, with higher population
	- **preventive check**: limit birth rate to live longer (raise LS)
	- also applicable to wolf/deer population in a forest

# Adam Smith
- underdevelopment = lack of division of labor, capital
	- -> lack of integrated markets
- specialization = higher skill levels
	- only if sustained by high demand
	- falls in demand can reverse specialization
- specialization has barriers (laborers die)
	- can be extended by education/skill sharing
- investments into new tools/innovations highly lucrative
	- e.g. dutch windmill evolution
