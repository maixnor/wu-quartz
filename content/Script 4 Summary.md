### Role of Trade
- raw materials and food for core countries
	- e.g. raw cotton to UK
- consume produced products
	- e.g. cotton cloth from UK
- -> [[Market Integration]]
- can overproduce locally and sell to other countries
	- actively search for new markets
- slightly higher export prices over time

### Trade and Transaction Costs
- [[Distance Cost]]

### Trade Policy Liberalization
- lowered import/export tariffs (first in UK, then the rest)
- AVE ... tariffs
![[tariffs_vs_import.png]]
#### example: japan opening after 1853
- Harris treaty of 1858
- [[Comparative Advantage]] emerged naturally
	- Silk, silkworm eggs, tea exported
	- cotton yarn, sugar, rice imported
- industrialization happening after opening

### Gold Standard

- before 1815 europe in war all the time
	- embargoes -> cant trade with enemy
	- privateering -> private pirates instead of actual navies
	- wartime -> merchant ships converted into warships
	- uncertainty

### Imperialism
- [[Imperialism]]
## Glob and Spec - Consequences
### Prices converging
