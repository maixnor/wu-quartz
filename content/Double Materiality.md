- what is material?
## outside-in perspective
- getting costs of outside factors into the reporting
- financial materiality of company
- relevant for investors
- e.g. due to climate change there is less water in the river -> less production in water power plant
- e.g. due to climate change your farm is experiencing worse droughts -> higher costs for watering (if possible even to operate further)
## inside-out perspective
- getting costs from the supply chain into the reporting
- costs which are not financially carried by the company but by other communities or the environment
- e.g. CO2 emmissions
- e.g. human rights violation in production chains
