> what is material?

#todo find good definition

- Dynamic Materiality
	- impact materiality becoming financial materiality
	- e.g. chocolate producer which has the impact materiality (climate change) turn into a financial materiality (loss of raw resource due to heatwaves/wildfires)

# Perspectives
## outside-in perspective
- aka "financial materiality"
- getting costs of outside factors into the reporting
- relevant for investors
- e.g. due to [[climate change]] there is less water in the river -> less production in water power plant
- e.g. due to [[climate change]] your farm is experiencing worse droughts -> higher costs for watering (if possible even to operate further)
- "finanzielle Wesentlichkeit"
## inside-out perspective
- aka "impact materiality"
- getting costs from the supply chain into the reporting
- costs which are not financially carried by the company but by other communities or the environment
- e.g. CO2 emmissions
- e.g. [[human rights]] violation in production chains
- "auswirkende Wesentlichkeit"
