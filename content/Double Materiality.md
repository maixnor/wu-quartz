# What is Material?

> Anything which can affect the company is material. Be that financial material (I can't produce anymore) to impact material (humans are suffering). Can be either or, can be both.

- Dynamic Materiality
	- impact materiality becoming financial materiality
	- e.g. chocolate producer which has the impact materiality (climate change) turn into a financial materiality (loss of raw resource due to heatwaves/wildfires)
- "Double Materiality" means that we take a look at both perspectives
	- it does not need to be financial and impact to count as double
	
# Perspectives
## outside-in perspective (financial)
- aka "financial materiality"
- getting costs of outside factors into the reporting
- relevant for investors
- e.g. due to [[climate change]] there is less water in the river -> less production in water power plant
- e.g. due to [[climate change]] your farm is experiencing worse droughts -> higher costs for watering (if possible even to operate further)
- "finanzielle Wesentlichkeit"

## inside-out perspective (impact)
- aka "impact materiality"
- getting costs from the supply chain into the reporting
- costs which are not financially carried by the company but by other communities or the environment
- e.g. CO2 emmissions
- e.g. [[human rights]] violation in production chains
- "auswirkende Wesentlichkeit"

# Impacts, Risks, Opportunities
- aka IROs
- big part of [[Materiality Assesment]]
- impact materiality
	- positive/negative impacts
	- actual/potential
	- scale, scope, irremediability, likelihood
	- create list of everything
- financial materiality
	- risks/opportunities
	- potential magnitude, likelihood
- allows for separate ranking of impact/financial
	- then combined for actual [[double materiality]]
